From lore-inspired tattoos to inclusion in various video games, both fan-made and publicly produced, The Shape has easily established his unmovable legacy as one of the most profitable and perceptible horror villains in the mainstay genre.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Without a doubt, Michael’s influence has stretched far beyond John Carpenter’s 1978 original and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entered into various timelines</a>, many of which retcon other franchise sequels. On the surface, Michael is a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer with a thirst for destruction — although many horror junkies might actually be uneducated when it comes to the truth of Michael’s often concealed past.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=860 data-injectable=true>Across thirteen films in the long-standing Halloween franchise, Michael Myers has consistently stalked, tormented, and brutalized a large collection of members in the Haddonfield, Illinois community. Officially introduced in Halloween (1978), Michael Myers became known as a vicious psychopath with an intent on killing members of his own family — which eventually spawned an ever-popular rivalry with his younger adopted sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>With the franchise expected to reach an impending hiatus after the release of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween Ends</a> this week, it remains to be seen when and where the future of Michael Myers will continue. For now, let’s explore the spine-tingling events within Michael Myers’ extraordinary existence, starting from the very beginning.</p><h2 id=h-michael-myers-murders-his-older-sister-judith-on-halloween-night-in-1963 data-injectable=false>Michael Myers murders his older sister Judith on Halloween night in 1963</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-michael-myers-young.jpg><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, the bone-chilling opening sequence in John Carpenter’s 1978 masterpiece is the audience’s initial introduction to The Shape. In the movie’s opening moments, the audience is presented with a POV shot as someone lurks on the outskirts of the Myers’ household. In the opening’s climax, eagle-eyed viewers are introduced to 6-year-old Michael Myers — who has just completed the shocking murder of his older sister Judith Myers. Despite being a young child, diehards were immediately introduced to Michael’s deeply rooted misery.</p><h2 id=h-michael-is-eventually-sent-away-to-smith-s-grove-sanitarium data-injectable=false>Michael is eventually sent away to Smith’s Grove Sanitarium</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/michael-myers-smiths-grove.jpg><p data-characters=562 data-current-count=862 data-injectable=true>After Michael brutally murdered his sister in cold blood, Michael was discovered by his parents, who were at a party when the crime was committed. In the aftermath, Michael was sent away to Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, where he would spend his time in isolation until his 21st birthday. During his time at the institution, Michael had frequent visits with Dr. Sam Loomis — a child psychiatrist who took an interest in Michael’s case. Over time, Looms drew up the conclusion that Michael was “evil,” and that he should never be freed from psychiatric care.</p><h2 id=h-michael-escapes-from-smith-s-grove-and-returns-to-haddonfield data-injectable=false>Michael escapes from Smith’s Grove and returns to Haddonfield</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/michael-myers-laurie-strode.jpg><p data-characters=695 data-current-count=995 data-injectable=true>On the night before Halloween in 1978, Michael destroyed his room at Smith’s Grove, killed several hospital employees and attacked Sam Loomis and Nurse Marion Chambers — where he then stole their car and drove himself back to Haddonfield to hunt for his sister Laurie. When Michael finally reached Haddonfield, after killing a mechanic along the way and stealing his attire, he stalked Laurie and her friends while they were walking home for school. On Halloween night, Michael attempted to murder his sister, after having already murdered most of her friends. Much to the relief of Laurie, Michael was presumably shot and “killed” by Sam Loomis — although “evil” never truly dies.</p><h2 id=h-michael-is-presumably-killed-in-a-disastrous-hospital-fire data-injectable=false>Michael is presumably killed in a disastrous hospital fire</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/michael-myers-halloween-2.jpg><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>After attempting to recover from his vicious wounds, Michael returned later in the night, after Loomis had already taken Laurie Strode to a local hospital. Unbeknownst to the duo, Michael was still alive and running amok throughout the hospital. Eventually, Michael locates Laurie, and the two engage in a bone-chilling battle — which subsequently enlists the help of Dr. Loomis.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Amidst the chaos, Loomis learns the horrifying truth that Michael and Laurie are actually siblings, and that Laurie was adopted by the Strode family after her and Michael’s parents died in a tragic car accident. In the end, Loomis purposely causes an explosion to occur in the basement of the hospital, which seemingly kills Michael while Loomis and Laurie escape.</p><h2 id=h-michael-is-revealed-to-be-cursed-and-hellbent-on-killing-members-of-his-family data-injectable=false>Michael is revealed to be cursed and hellbent on killing members of his family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/halloween-6-e1652208064762.png><p data-characters=601 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>After Halloween III: Season of the Witch tanked at the box office, only after trying to create a separate narrative from the Michael Myers’ lore, the infamous villain was brought back in a series of sequels, which ditched the Laurie Strode character arc and instead focused on Michael’s niece Jamie Lloyd. In the fresh-faced sequels, Michael and Jamie are revealed to hold a special supernatural connection, where Jamie is able to experience premonitions of Michael’s vicious crimes. Eventually, Jamie adopts Michael’s powers and thirst for murder, although she is later murdered by her uncle.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>In addition, the Halloween sequels introduce a Cult of Thorn storyline, which insists that Michael Myers had an ancient druid curse placed upon him at birth. According to the curse, it will only be lifted after Michael murders all members of his bloodline as a sacrifice. In doing so, Michael continues his purse to kill his niece, after having already tortured his sister years prior.</p><h2 id=h-michael-stalks-laurie-and-her-son-john-in-california data-injectable=false>Michael stalks Laurie and her son John in California</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-h20-fans-remember.jpg><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>In 1998, Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later marked a refreshing return to the franchise, which aimed to ignore all of the lackluster sequels and focus on the events that occurred in the first two original Halloween films. In H20, Laurie Strode effectively changed her name after being placed into the Witness Protection Program. Under the alias Keri Tate, Strode lives with her teenage son John and serves as the Headmistress of a private boarding school in California.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, Michael eventually learns the true whereabouts of his sister and heads to California to finally accomplish her demise. The duo’s intense rivalry culminates in a vicious climax, where Laurie presumably kills Michael by decapitating him — although it’s revealed in Halloween: Resurrection that it wasn’t actually Michael Myers.</p><h2 id=h-michael-continues-his-hunt-for-laurie-strode-in-the-updated-trilogy data-injectable=false>Michael continues his hunt for Laurie Strode in the updated trilogy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-ends-post-credits-scene.jpg><p data-characters=655 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>Without a doubt, David Gordon Green’s modern Halloween trilogy has successfully reinvigorated the franchise’s presence in the slasher sub-genre, which has simultaneously introduced an entirely new generation to the horror of Michael Myers. Unlike prior versions of Michael that appear less tame, this version of Michael is completely cold-hearted and unapologetically ruthless. In Halloween (2018), Michael appears to have been sitting in Smith’s Grove for most of his adult life, ever since the eye-watering events that took place in the 1978 original. As for Laurie Strode, she has been dealing with a tremendous amount of trauma, PTSD, and grief.</p><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=false>Eventually, Michael escapes after a horrific bus accident and sets his sights on the one thing that he has spent decades waiting for — to kill Laurie Strode. One of the most interesting differences in Green’s trilogy is that Michael and Laurie are not siblings, which means Michael is determined to hunt Laurie for no reason other than to simply kill people for sport. And with the trilogy coming to an end this week (Oct. 14) with the release of Halloween Ends, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s unclear where the future</a> of Halloween and Michael Myers will go from here — but diehards will certainly always be waiting for the next step.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZi8rrzLnqueZZiewLW70bJkqJ5doraktMCeo2alqZq%2FtHnFq6amZZiWua271p6cp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juju-smith-schuster-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Juju Smith-Schuster Net Worth: How Much Is Juju Smith-Schuster Worth?</span></a>
