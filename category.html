Instead of standing at the stove, flipping slices to order, you pile cubed bread into a casserole dish, douse it in a rich, cinnamon-spiced custard, and bake it with pecans and brown sugar on top. It’s a breeze to assemble on the morning you plan to serve it, but if you want to streamline this French toast casserole recipe even more, you can put it together the day before and let it sit overnight in the fridge. The next morning, all you have to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Roasted mushrooms are underrated.&nbsp;Prove me wrong: when you have mushrooms you need to use up in the fridge, is roasting the first way you think to cook them? My guess is not. Many of us are more likely to sauté mushrooms on the stove than roast them in the oven. But as delicious as sautéed mushrooms are, I’d argue that roasted mushrooms are&nbsp;even better.&nbsp;They’re crisp around the edges, meaty in the middle, and packed with savory, umami flavor.&nbsp;Plus, they roast on a single sheet pan in under 30 minutes. I’m sharing my simple roasted mushrooms recipe below. Serve it as…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Here’s the good news: perfect hard boiled eggs are easy to make. …And the bad news: so are less-than-perfect ones. I don’t know about you, but I’ve certainly cooked my fair share of the latter. When you try to peel away the shell, half the whites come along with it, or when you cut it open, the yolk is slightly green instead of brilliant yellow. Pretty disappointing, if you ask me. See, cooking perfect hard boiled eggs is easy, but that doesn’t mean that the process you use doesn’t matter. After years of trial and error, I’m happy to say…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>All our best appetizers, all in one place! If you’re hosting a party or looking for a dish to bring to one, I promise—these easy appetizer recipes will not disappoint. They range from indulgent dips to bite-sized finger foods, gorgeous snack boards, and baked treats. These appetizers are the nibbles and bites that I love to serve when I’m entertaining. They’re simple to make (and often make ahead) and easy to serve (bonus points if you don’t need utensils!). But most importantly, they’re fun and delicious. They keep the prep straightforward for you while delivering big, bold flavors for guests.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>To me, roasted carrots are the perfect veggie side dish.&nbsp;They’re easy to make, but they’re also amazingly flavorful. The hot oven intensifies the carrots’ natural sweetness, and it makes them soft and tender, with lightly crisp, caramelized edges. I can never resist eating some straight off the baking sheet! You’ll find my favorite roasted carrots recipe below. In addition to the olive oil, salt, and pepper I’d toss with any roasted vegetable, I use some honey here. It lightly glazes the carrots and helps them brown and caramelize in the oven. Make this recipe to round out a weeknight dinner,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Scalloped potatoes always make me think of Easter. My family had them at our holiday dinner every year when I was growing up. Cheesy, rich, and comforting, they were my favorite part of the meal. I’d happily skip the Easter ham and go back for a second serving of scalloped potatoes instead! Since this classic dish is one of my Easter favorites, I wanted to share a recipe for it this spring. Finally—after lots of testing and tweaking—it’s here: my favorite scalloped potatoes recipe. It features tender potatoes baked in a creamy sauce with fresh thyme, onions, and cheddar cheese.&nbsp;…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Easter is right around the corner, and I’m busy picking out which side dishes to make for our holiday feast. No offense to ham or lamb, but the side dishes are always my favorite part of Easter dinner. If you ask me, they’re what make the meal memorable. Seasonal vegetables like carrots and asparagus add a pop of color to the table. Hearty potato recipes keep guests coming back for more. And spring salads like my strawberry salad or carrot salad offer bright, fresh flavor. I’ve rounded up my 50 best Easter side dishes below.&nbsp;If you’re still figuring out your…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The best deviled eggs are easy to make.&nbsp;You just need 6 basic ingredients: hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. If you like, you can add a dash of hot sauce or a pinch of paprika to kick the flavors up a notch. But without them, your deviled eggs will still be delicious. Because classic deviled eggs are so tasty AND so simple, they’re a perfect appetizer for Easter, the holidays, parties…any occasion, really. I’m sharing my favorite deviled eggs recipe below, plus tips and variations so that you can make it your own.

She’s been making her famous breakfast casserole recipe on Easter and Christmas morning for as long as I can remember. The rest of my family loves it because it’s hearty and flavorful, packed with potatoes, veggies, eggs, and cheese. My mom loves it because it’s easy to make and—even better—make ahead.&nbsp;She can prep the whole thing the night before and pop it in the oven when guests arrive the next day. I adapted this breakfast casserole recipe from hers, and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This French 75 recipe is my favorite cocktail. Bubbly, botanical, lemony, and lightly sweet, it’s exactly what I want to be drinking on New Year’s Eve…or anytime, really. A French 75 is easy to make at home with 4 simple ingredients. If you’re looking for an elegant, refreshing cocktail recipe to mix up for happy hours, parties, or even brunch, you should definitely try this one! In case you’re not familiar, a French 75 is a Champagne cocktail made with gin or cognac, lemon juice, and simple syrup. Ever had a Tom Collins? It’s like that, but topped with Champagne…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Let’s make Christmas cookies!&nbsp;The holiday season is here, and I’m ready to bake. Every year, I make Christmas cookies to share with friends and family. These sweet treats are my favorite way to spread holiday cheer. They look so festive—cut into seasonal shapes, decorated with icing, or dusted with powdered sugar—and they taste delicious. If you want to make someone smile this season, gift them a Christmas cookie tray. Just be sure to save some cookies for yourself too! I’ve rounded up my best Christmas cookie recipes below.
