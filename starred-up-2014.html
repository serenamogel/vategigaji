<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Starred Up movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It’s hard to describe “Starred Up” without making it sound generic. It’s another prison drama, a genre that felt exhausted many, many years ago. And it’s another tale of a genetic predisposition for violence as we soon learn that Eric’s father Neville (the great <a href=#>Ben Mendelsohn</a> of “The Place Beyond the Pines” and “Animal Kingdom”) is in the same prison as his son. Neville first spies Eric across the yard and glares him down in the way a disappointed parent does before a beating. Eric has been thrown into an ultra-violent, alpha male world, and it’s not one where having your father around is necessarily a good thing. Human connection, for both of these men, will prove to be a double-edged sword. In many ways, it’s a work about a father’s anger that both protects and derails his son.</p><p>Eric will have another father figure in his life, a group therapist named Oliver (<a href=#>Rupert Friend</a>), who convinces the prison Governor (Sam Spruell) to give the young man a chance at rehabilitation after a particularly violent incident. In group sessions that almost always end in outbursts and violence, Oliver does his best to try a different parental tactic with Eric. There’s a defining scene in which Eric flouts authority by lighting up a cigarette in group and Oliver tries discipline—verbal admonition and essentially putting the group in a “time out”—before Neville bursts in with the physical response: “<i>Problem is you’ve got to come down on him full throttle; else it won’t register</i>.” It’s corporal punishment versus detention even in the prison system. The dynamic between a biological father and a father figure behind bars is fascinating; both men try to protect him and both simply cannot in this kind of world.</p><p>While all of that subtext makes “Starred Up” fascinating, it is primarily a character piece for the young Mr. O’Connell, an actor who reminds one of <a href=#>Tom Hardy</a> in “<a href=#>Bronson</a>” or the early work of <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> in his fearlessness. There’s a scene early on in which Eric knows the guards are coming for him. He races back to his cell, pours oil on the floor, and then douses himself in the stuff too. It’ll make it harder to take him down. And he grabs a couple of wooden planks for good measure. He’s not getting “out.” They have nightsticks, helmets and shields. But he’ll do some damage on his way down. “Starred Up” is a film about someone sliding out of society, and kicking, screaming and punching as he does so. And O’Connell captures that in a way that so many more experienced, well-known actors would miss. It’s in the incredible physical balance between prison-earned toughness and youth. There’s just a hint of fear in O’Connell’s eyes, reminding us that he was just a kid not that long ago. O’Connell’s performance is matched but never upstaged by the increasingly fantastic Ben Mendelsohn, an even more blatantly conflicted blend of rage and familial concern, and Rupert Friend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sq5qqopqxbsHPZmlpaWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flirt-1996.html><span>←</span><span>Flirt movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1996)</span></a>
