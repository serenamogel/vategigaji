I remember when the notion of sexual addiction was first being mentioned. People treated it as a joke. It was referred to in late-night monologues. The American Psychiatric Association in 1987 defined it as a mental disorder involving "distress about a pattern of repeated sexual conquests … involving a succession of people who exist only as things to be used." The APA is no longer certain it is a disorder. Whatever it is, Brandon suffers from it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Thomas Martineau Accident: Paralysis And Health 2023</h2><time>Apr 5, 2024</time>

¡Ay, mi amor! ¡Ay, mi amor!

<a href=../../../../the-lenovo-yoga-c930-review-atmos-acoustics.html></a>
Display Analysis Lenovo offers two displays in the Yoga C930, with the base model being a 1920x1080 IPS panel, and the upgrade is a 3840x2160 IPS version. Both of course offer multi-touch, and active pen support. Officially the display is listed as a 13.9-inch version. The 1080p version offers 158 pixels per inch, and the 2160p model is about 317 pixels per inch, which is a big difference. The benefit of the lower resolution display is battery life, in addition to cost, and some people would be able to run it at 100% scaling to avoid any issues there, although Windows defaults this display to 150% out of the box.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'Mayans M.C.'
