Far Flungers A love letter to Iran Michael Mirasol &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2012-03-09 These days when you mention Iran, we think of a nation on the brink of war. Extremist images come to mind, full of concealed women and bearded militants. Such stereotypes are useful in the drum up to war. But rarely do we step back to remember when Iran was as European as Europe, or that an autocracy does not necessarily reflect its people.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Electric Light Orchestra - Livin' Thing Lyrics Meaning</h2><time>Jul 24, 2024</time>
