Today it was noticed, without any fanfare from Intel, that Knights Mill information has been uploaded to Intel’s specification database ARK. There are three known SKUs so far, with up to 72 cores and a 320W TDP. The Xeon Phi 'Knights Mill' products are a new iteration on the older 'Knights Landing' family, with a silicon change for additional AVX-512 instructions.

Whether you’re a boomer and think fondly of wiggly salads from your childhood, or you’re a ’90s kid fantasizing about the whimsical shapes of Jigglers, Jell-O is a mainstay in most homes because it’s easy to make and really fun to eat. But what is Jell-O? Let’s slurp down some knowledge.&nbsp;
What is Jell-O made of?The secret ingredient is…gelatin! Gelatin is a food additive that is derived from animal collagen. The skin, bones, and connective tissues of cows, pigs, chickens, and other domesticated animals all have collagen in them.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Peanut Butter Banana Bread - Mom On Timeout</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>

Exceptionally delicious Peanut Butter Banana Bread! This incredibly moist banana bread is made with peanut butter and Reese’s Peanut Butter chips for a fabulous peanut butter flavor!
PIN IT NOW! Earlier this week I noticed I had some bananas that were getting a little too ripe to eat. My husband suggested Banana Bread and it sounded a little boring to me for some reason. I thought about making my Banana Blueberry Bread but wanted to try something new and that’s when it hit me – why not add peanut butter?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Best Bean Dip According to Our Taste Tests (Updated)</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../best-bean-dip.html></a>
The best bean dip is so much more than refried beans slopped into a bowl. It should be rich and nuanced with a creamy texture and some interesting spice. Store bought bean dip—even if it’s canned bean dip—should still taste like the first course at a Mexican restaurant, just as tantalizing as the fresh pico de gallo and warm tortilla chips served next to it.&nbsp;
Here at Sporked, we’ve come to the conclusion that canned bean dip is an untapped market.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jamilah Lemieux Father: Age, Wiki, Instagram Daughter and Facts</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../jennifer-anistons-wrist-tattoo-explained.html></a>
Though Jennifer Aniston hasn't talked officially about the meaning behind her "11 11" tattoo, a source told People that Aniston is a "very spiritual" person, and that the actor thinks the numbers are good luck. The number seems to hold a lot of significance for her: her birthday is February 11, and her beloved dog Norman — for whom Aniston got her first tattoo, his name in script on the arch of her foot — died in 2011.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Netflix Returns to True Crime with Tedious Docuseries Evil Genius | TV/Streaming</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>

Before I go on, this is where I must preface that I have seen only the two episodes that Netflix provided, and am&nbsp;reviewing the four-part “Evil Genius” without knowing where it all ends. But as someone more than ready to find a new Netflix obsession, the project always felt like it wanted to be simply shocking, instead of challenging.&nbsp;It feels like a gravely missed opportunity, given the fascinating people, the events, and the various ideas of humanity that lurk around this true story.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Our kitchen tour on the kitchn</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>

I’m excited today to share this tour of our kitchen on The Kitchn! As this post goes live, we will be on a way-too-long flight home from Spain… longing to be back home.
We’ve had a great trip, but I am excited to get back to my kitchen. After two weeks of eating ourselves silly, a good healthy detox will be in order… And when that’s done, I’ve got a notebook full of travel-inspired recipe ideas&nbsp;to try out.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Where is Reacher Filmed?</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>
