Both V. komodoensis and dinosaurs belong to the subclass Diapsida which is branched into two infraclasses: Archosauria (dinosaurs, including birds) and Lepidosauria (tuataras, lizards, and snakes).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-a-komodo-dragon-a-dragon-or-dinosaur></span>Is a Komodo Dragon a dragon or dinosaur?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Komodo Dragon, tough considered by many intellectual groups to carry the same traits, characteristics and DNA strand that would otherwise link its ancestors to the Prehistoric Period, is by default only <b>a very large reptile and not a dinosaur</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-komodo-dragons-ancient></span>Are Komodo dragons ancient?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Komodo dragons <b>are ancient</b><p>Though only discovered by Europeans in 1910, Komodos are considered a relict of giant lizards that have existed in Flores for at least 900,000 years.

That said, it’s very likely that dinosaurs are close ancestors of Komodo dragons. … Because of this, many experts believe that <b>Komodo dragons are the closest living relative to dinosaurs today</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-alligators-and-komodo-dragons-related></span>Are alligators and komodo dragons related?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>No. Alligators, crocodiles, and komodo dragons are considered to be <b>REPTILES</b> — part of the phylogenetic group known as Diapsids. Komodo dragons are lizards, part of a group of reptiles known as Lepidosaurs. Alligators and crocodiles are part of a different group of reptiles, known as Archosaurs.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-komodo-dragons-only-found-in-indonesia></span>Are Komodo dragons only found in Indonesia?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Komodo dragons are <b>only found in the wild on a handful of Indonesian islands</b> where they are estimated to have roamed for millions of years. They draw visitors from around the world and in recent years authorities have grappled with how to manage conservation and tourism in the national park.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-is-stronger-crocodile-or-komodo-dragon></span>Which is stronger crocodile or Komodo dragon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The crocodile by far is superior</b> due to its ability to hunt on land and water, along with bone crushing jaws. The Komodo has shear like teeth, good for tearing and shredding their prey but their teeth length would only give the crocodile abrasions even if the Komodo manages to pierce the skin.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-animal-kills-a-komodo-dragon></span>What animal kills a Komodo dragon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-the-difference-between-a-gila-monster-and-a-komodo-dragon></span>What’s the difference between a gila monster and a Komodo dragon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>A komodo dragon is more deadly to humans than a Gila monster</b> because a Gila monster usually only bites when it is intimidated whereas a komodo dragon will bite out of hunger. Originally Answered: Who is more deadly a komodo dragon or Gila monster? Despite the name, Gila Monsters aren’t really “monsters” to us.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-strongest-reptile></span>Who is the strongest reptile?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>saltwater crocodile Out of all of the big and powerful animals in the world, it might surprise you to learn that <b>the saltwater crocodile</b> takes the prize for the animal with the strongest bite. Interestingly, the saltwater crocodile is also the world’s heaviest reptile, weighing up to 2,200 pounds.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-a-crocodile-eat-a-komodo-dragon></span>Can a crocodile eat a Komodo dragon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-a-komodo-dragon-have-a-predator></span>Does a Komodo dragon have a predator?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Komodo Dragon Predators and Threats<p>Due to the fact that <b>the Komodo Dragon is the most dominant predator in its environment</b>, mature adults have no natural predators in their native habitats.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-animal-has-the-strongest-bite></span>What animal has the strongest bite?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The Hippopotamus</b> has the strongest bite of all land animals at about 1820 PSI.
