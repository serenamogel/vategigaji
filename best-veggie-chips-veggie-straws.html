<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Best Veggie Chips and Veggie Straws [Taste Test]</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class=has-medium-font-size>Veggie chips and veggie stick chips satisfy a very specific kind of craving. If you really want chips, they probably won’t cut it. And if you really want vegetables, they definitely won’t do the trick. They are their own snack category now. And there’s more than just Garden Veggie Straws out there.&nbsp;</p><p>Before we talk about the taste and texture and enjoyment of veggie chips, let’s address the whole good-for-you thing: Are veggie chips healthy? Actual vegetables are, of course, much healthier. And, sadly, veggie chips often aren’t much different than potato chips. Most are made primarily of fried potato with some powdered vegetable thrown in for flavor and color. But some brands do advertise having less fat than regular potato chips. So, in short, no, you can’t replace actual carrot sticks with veggie stick chips. But that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy them as their own kind of crispy, crunchy, tasty snack.&nbsp;</p><p>So, with that out of the way, let’s talk about the search for the best veggie chips. We tasted 14 different flavors, shapes, and brands of veggie chips. We looked for crunch, seasoning, and actual veggie flavor. Because if there’s no veggie flavor, why bother? You might as well just eat an actual potato chip.&nbsp;</p><p>We found seven delicious bagfuls that we all agreed were worth recommending—and one honorable mention. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Garden Veggie Straws Screamin’ Hot</a> divided the group. Both managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> and senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> liked them, but I just think the flavor is all over the place. The spicy straws get points for genuine heat, but there’s no real flavor beyond that. Too one note for me, sadly. Still, if you want something crunchy and spicy, give them a try.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the seven best veggie chips we all think are worth adding to snacktime.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Off the Eaten Path Chickpea Veggie Crisps" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_VEGGIE_CHIPS_INSET_07.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Low Sodium</strong></p><strong>Off the Eaten Path Chickpea Veggie Crisps</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>At 150 mg of sodium per serving, these are the lowest sodium veggie chips on this list. But they still pack some good, snack-worthy flavor. There’s just a touch of salt and a lot of hearty legume flavor in these multi-colored chips. They’re made with chickpeas, rice, peas, and black beans—a departure from the usual mix of spinach and tomato. They’re also sturdy enough to dip!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Sensible Portions Garden Veggie Wavy Chips Sea Salt" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_VEGGIE_CHIPS_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Chip Substitute</strong></p><strong>Sensible Portions</strong> <strong>Garden Veggie Wavy Chips Sea Salt</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>There’s not a ton of veggie flavor in these small, orecchiette-esque chips. But they’re extremely crunchy. “They taste more fried,” Jordan said. And that’s why I think Garden Veggie Chips are the best replacement for a classic potato chip if you’re looking for something marginally healthier. They boast 30% less fat than the “leading puffed snack,” as well as no artificial flavors or preservatives. It’s definitely not the same as swapping out chips for hummus and carrots, but it’s a step in that direction.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Simple Truth Veggie Chips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_VEGGIE_CHIPS_INSET_06.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Veggie Flavor</strong></p><strong>Simple Truth Veggie Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>There’s no denying that these are veggie chips. They have so much veggie flavor. The tomato chip tastes like tomato. The spinach chip tastes like spinach. The chips are curvy and fun to eat and they are audibly crunchy. If you want the real veggie chip experience, buy a bagful of these.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Good Health Veggie Chips Sea Salt" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_VEGGIE_CHIPS_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Bite-Sized</strong></p><strong>Good Health Veggie Chips Sea Salt</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Vons</a><p>The bag would have you believe that these are pretty big chips, but don’t believe it—they are tiny, like silver dollars. At first, I was taken aback. But then I popped one in my mouth and ate it in one bite. Delightful. They have a good crunch and the colors have distinct flavors. They’re excellent veggie chips for mindless munching.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Vons</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Good Health Veggie Straws Sea Salt" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_VEGGIE_CHIPS_INSET_01.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Classic Veggie Straws</strong></p><strong>Good Health Veggie Straws Sea Salt</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Vons</a><p>I love the crunch on these veggie straws and appreciate that the person or robot who made them had a light hand with the salt. And this might seem like a small thing, but they don’t leave a coating on your tongue after you swallow like many fried, chip-esque things do. They’re very veggie-forward in flavor, though I’m hard pressed to identify a specific vegetable. Overall, these aren’t the best veggie chips but they are the best classic veggie straws we tried and I’d be happy to see them in the pantry.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Vons</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Sensible Portions Garden Veggie Straws Zesty Ranch" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_VEGGIE_CHIPS_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Ranch Flavored</strong></p><strong>Sensible Portions Garden Veggie Straws Zesty Ranch</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>If you love ranch, these are the ranch-dusted veggie straws of your dreams. “They say ‘zesty ranch’ and it is zesty ranch,” said Gwynedd, swooning. Ranch and vegetables go together, obviously, and so do ranch and veggie sticks chips. The creamy ranch complements the veggie flavors in these sticks, and Sensible Portions ironically went very heavy on the ranch—to everyone’s delight.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Simple Truth Popped Root Veggie Crisps Sea Salt" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_VEGGIE_CHIPS_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Simple Truth Popped Root Veggie Crisps Sea Salt</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>Here’s how Simple Truth should be marketing these crisps: mini papadums! The cumin in these incredible veggie chips makes them taste like tiny, rice-based papadums. Incredible. I accept that these are not technically chips—they’re crisps. But they are just way too good to be anywhere but the top of this list. “These are outrageously good and I would be so happy if someone recommended them to me,” said Gwynedd. The packaging makes it seem like these would be bland mini rice cakes. Don’t believe it! They are chock full of flavor from the veggies (chickpeas, shallots, beets, and carrots—a fun, out-of-the-box mix) as well as the seasoning. Do yourself a favor and buy them immediately.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Ralphs</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other veggie chip brands we tried: </strong>Earth’s Best Organic Garden Veggie Straws Original, Garden Veggie Chips Sour Cream and Onion, Terra Original Real Vegetable Chips, Simple Truth Exotic Vegetable Chips, Garden Veggie Straws Cheddar Cheese, Garden Veggie Straws Screamin Hot, Garden Veggie Chips Cheddar Cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuwsSgnqKdXZi1qrzSZq2en5eesm6%2F06uYsKtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abella-andersons-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Abella Andersons Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
