Andy Park, Marvel Studios’ director of visual development and concept art, shared the poster on Twitter recently after it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released at D23 over the weekend</a>.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>As you can see below, WandaVision&nbsp;will have a 50s sitcom vibe as it seems Scarlet Witch and Vis are in a cosy artificial reality. However, the real world is creeping in. Just look at the happy couple’s shadows – Paul Bettany’s looks like his android form while Wanda’s perfectly matches her comic book silhouette.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Wandavision-First-Poster-1.jpg><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Elizabeth Olsen previously teased at Comic-Con that&nbsp;WandaVision&nbsp;would be a deep dive into her character and also reveal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how she gets her superhero name</a> at last. If the show’s ticking off that box, then it makes sense that it would also give the heroine her traditional costume, too. This actually fits with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Got This Covered’s own intel</a>, as we’ve heard that Wanda will be sporting her classic look in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>WV&nbsp;will directly lead into Doctor Strange 2,&nbsp;which will co-star Olsen as Wanda joins Stephen Strange in his trek through the weird, wide multiverse. Given that, it seems her fake life with Vision won’t last forever, which has led to fan theories wondering if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Witch could actually be the secret villain</a> of the movie instead.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=false>Time will tell, but for now, what we know for sure is that with shooting getting underway later this year, <strong>WandaVision</strong>&nbsp;is due on Disney Plus in early 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4rc2dmK%2Bho568r3nPqKqtnaJiwaat0p6qZquTlr%2BtsdNmrqKsk53Abq%2FLmqqsoZNisLC5yJyqZpufqMG2ucRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-2014.html><span>←</span><span>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies movie review (2014)</span></a>
