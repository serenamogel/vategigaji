Mostly how it did that was by its pitch-perfect renderings of the titular cosmic heroes. Two of them, for example,&nbsp;are instantly familiar to any moviegoer nowadays – Star-Lord, with his leather jacket and helmet and Rocket, who’s basically just a raccoon on his hind legs.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>The piece of concept art below, however, which unveils an unused design for these two characters, teases just how different Peter Quill and his trash panda pal could have looked in James Gunn’s space-age action-comedy. As created by Marvel Studios’ chief concept artist Ryan Meinerding, the design features a much more gritty-looking take on the duo, against a backdrop of some battle-torn war zone.</p><p data-characters=19 data-current-count=19 data-injectable=false>Check it out below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/eWk8uKrDZi3tn7m1D1cH5-imJc3GZoTaYNoG4ee5Nhc.jpg><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>What’s perhaps most interesting here is that&nbsp;Star-Lord’s casual fashion sense that so befits Chris Pratt’s portrayal of the legendary outlaw is replaced by a very militarized suit of armor. The helmet also covers his entire head and doesn’t show off&nbsp;his luscious locks. It’s a radically different take on the character compared to what we’re familiar with,&nbsp;but this design does resemble Peter’s traditional depiction in the comics.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=false>As for Rocket, Meinerding seems to have decided to make him much more alien here, rather than the eventual decision to design the character as an Earth-based raccoon given increased intelligence due to being experimented on. Again, this does pay homage to the<strong>&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy</strong>&nbsp;comics in which Rocket hails from an alien world, but having said that, we’re glad they didn’t go with this take, as he definitely would have been harder to love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonq6Zopm2orrSZp6apJGtxm6vzqeanqikYq6zwIysq5qqXaG8s7CMq6aco5WpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-hawks-get-his-wings-back-in-my-hero-academia.html><span>←</span><span>Does Hawks get his wings back in My Hero Academia?</span></a>
