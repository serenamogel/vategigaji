Born into poverty in New Orleans, she became a wealthy, beloved recording artist despite the limited opportunities allocated to Black women, her refusal to perform anything besides gospel standards and a willingness to wear her political affiliations on her sleeve. Here are eight moments in which the "Queen of Gospel" showcased her formidable influence beyond the recording studio:</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">August 1956: Democratic National Convention</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jackson had been stumping for preferred candidates for more than two decades, but she made her presence felt on a national scale at the August 1956 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Undaunted by the boisterous crowd, she quieted the delegates with the slowly building "I See God," before winning over remaining skeptics with a voice that powered through the International Amphitheatre. "There wasn't a sound," recalled her label owner and collaborator Mitch Miller in Laurraine Goreau's biography Just Mahalia, Baby. "You ... didn't dare breathe, it was such a tremendous moment. There wasn't a dry eye in the house when she got through."</p><img alt="Mahalia Jackson" title="Mahalia Jackson" width=4404 height=5291 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1155894213.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: CBS via Getty Images</span><p>Mahalia Jackson</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">December 1956: Montgomery Bus Boycott</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the foot soldiers of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Montgomery Bus Boycott" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a> strained to reach the finish line, their movement got a much-needed jolt of star power with Jackson's performance at St. John A.M.E. Church on December 6, 1956. It was the first public pairing of the gospel queen and an ascendant Baptist minister named <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> While the boycott went down as a success with the city's capitulation two weeks later, the bombing of fellow minister <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/ralph-d-abernathy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ralph Abernathy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ralph Abernathy</a>'s home, where Jackson had stayed in Montgomery, demonstrated the immense risks undertaken by everyone involved.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">May 1957: Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="civil rights movement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">civil rights movement</a> continued gaining steam, Jackson joined its leaders to celebrate the third anniversary of the landmark <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/brown-v-board-of-education-of-topeka data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brown v.

The lone soloist invited to perform alongside the 14 speakers, Jackson roused the 25,000 people in attendance with one of her signature songs, "I've Been 'Buked and I've Been Scorned," though the day is perhaps best remembered for propelling King into the spotlight with his "Give Us the Ballot" speech.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">October 1960: King Frederik and Queen Ingrid's visit to Chicago</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having long since established herself as a Chicago mainstay, Jackson joined the city's power players to welcome Denmark's King Frederik and Queen Ingrid to an October 1960 reception hosted by Mayor Richard Daley. The songstress delivered the goods on stage, dazzling the visiting royals with her rendition of "Down by the Riverside," and displayed her unfiltered charm by pushing the queen to vote for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John F.

The event is remembered for numerous reasons, including the blizzard that knocked out television coverage and prevented some performers from returning to their hotel rooms to change outfits, but Jackson nevertheless found a way to stand out with her singing of the national anthem.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">August 1963: March on Washington</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of the defining moments of the civil rights era, the August 28, 1963, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/march-on-washington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="March on Washington" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">March on Washington</a> drew an estimated 250,000 people to the Lincoln Memorial to hear heavy-hitting activists <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/a-philip-randolph data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A.

Jackson thrilled as the final musical guest, performing "I've Been 'Buked and I've Been Scorned" and "How I Got Over," before nudging King toward history midway through his speech by urging him to "Tell 'em about <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/civil-rights-movement/i-have-a-dream-speech data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the dream" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the dream</a>, Martin."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">April 1968: Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jackson's final presentation for King came at a public service for the great orator, five days after he was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr-assassination data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fatally shot" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">fatally shot</a> on a Memphis hotel balcony in April 1968. After the funeral procession reached Atlanta's Morehouse College, the shaken singer honored her old friend's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/03/28/mlk-requested-a-song-minutes-before-his-assassination-and-that-tune-comforted-millions/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="last request" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">last request</a> with an emotional performance of the standard "Take My Hand, Precious Lord." As noted in Just Mahalia, Baby, Jackson "sang out her sorrow, sang a plea for forgiveness of mankind, sang for the soul she knew was sitting at Jesus' side. 'Save me a place, Martin. Save me a place.'"</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Spring 1971: Japan-India Performances</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">All but retired from public political efforts at this late stage of life, Jackson nevertheless dutifully represented the stars and stripes with a spring 1971 tour that brought her before the heads of state of Japan and India. The first Western singer invited to Japan's Imperial Palace since World War II, she delivered a series of standards described by Empress Nagako as "very moving of the spirit." Days later, Jackson made such an impression on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/indira-gandhi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Indira Gandhi" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Indira Gandhi</a> that the busy prime minister called off her planned exit from the New Delhi concert hall and stuck around, watching from a fire exit, as the gospel singer belted out "We Shall Overcome" for an encore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJopJqgkaG2onnJmpqkq5%2Bjeqq6xaWsnqaknq6tecyopJ6mpKg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-are-pralines.html><span>←</span><span>What Are Pralines? | Sporked</span></a>
