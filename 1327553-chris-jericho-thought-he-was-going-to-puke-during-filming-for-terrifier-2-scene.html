The low-budget movie has become a smash hit, as it has generated over $7 million in ticket sales. It has also turned into a viral sensation as some viewers have vomited, passed out or required medical attention while they were watching the movie. Jericho played a security guard in the mid-credits scene.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Screen Rant</a>, Jericho described how, in the process of shooting the scene, he thought he might throw up because he had to eat “gelatinous” food that was supposed to be a jellied eyeball.</p><p>“In the film, I have to eat like, a zombie platter. It’s Halloween, so my wife has made all these zombie treats,” Jericho said. “One of them was a jellied eyeball. I think it was kind of custard with some kind of almost the plastic candy, and I had to eat like five of them. They were cold, and they were gelatinous. It was really kind of getting to me. It was really gross. I remember [Damien] was like, ‘Can you just eat one more?’ I was like, ‘Dude, I’ll eat one more, and then that’s it! Because I’m gonna f***ing puke if I have to do another one of these.'”</p><p>“But these are the trials and tribulations of filming a horror movie. You’ve got to eat too many gelatinous eyeballs. But like I said, just how much work everybody was doing really was inspiring because everything that you see, they left 100% on the screen. So now Terrifier 2 is on 800 screens in theaters. That’s a real victory for all of us.”</p><p>The post-credits scene can be found <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p>Jericho also <a href=#>discussed his involvement</a> with the film in an interview with ComingSoon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJrbm5tY2Kwqb7IrGSjnaKesKm7jK2fqK2XncFutMRmrpqrXZy8qrrGZquoZaCquKZ5w66poqaXYrOquMyipaBllqS%2FbsDEq6minpmav25%2BjKyanqaV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cassandra-peterson.html><span>←</span><span>Cassandra Peterson</span></a>
