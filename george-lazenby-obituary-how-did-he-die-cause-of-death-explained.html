He attended Goulburn High School till 1954, having previously attended Goulburn Public School.</p><p>Barbara, his sister, was an accomplished dancer. He underwent surgery when he was young, which left him with just half a kidney, and he remained in the hospital for 18 months.&nbsp;Lazenby’s family moved from Goulburn to Queanbeyan when he was around 14 years old, where his father had a shop.&nbsp;He worked as a mechanic and car salesman after serving in the Australian Army.</p><h2>George Robert Lazenby’s Early Life: Is He Married?</h2><p>In 1973, Lazenby married <strong>Chrissie Townson</strong>, a Gannett family member and his three-year lover.&nbsp;After that, Zachary and Melanie were their children. Zachary was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor at the age of eleven and died at the age of 19. Melanie earned her real estate broker license in New York.&nbsp;In 2002, Lazenby married Pam Shriver, a former tennis player.
