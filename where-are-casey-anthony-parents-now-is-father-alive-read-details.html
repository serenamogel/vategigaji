Casey Anthony was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and manslaughter of a child in the first degree in October 2008.
She was also charged with giving authorities incorrect information. Cindy and George Anthony, her parents, supported her at the time.&nbsp;
They were almost as well-known in the public as Casey Anthony herself, and they were eager to learn the truth about the disappearance and death of their 2-year-old granddaughter Caylee."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
