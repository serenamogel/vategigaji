Her troubled childhood soon led to substance abuse and a wild reputation, which negatively impacted her career for many years. Barrymore co-founded Flower Films in 1995 and has since regained success as a talented actor, producer, and businesswoman, starring in movies such as The Wedding Singer, Charlie’s Angels, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Music and Lyrics. She has hosted the syndicated talk show The Drew Barrymore Show since 2020.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Drew Blythe Barrymore<br>BORN: February 22, 1975<br>BIRTHPLACE: Culver City, California<br>SPOUSES: Jeremy Thomas (1994-1995), Tom Green (2001-2002), and Will Kopelman (2012-2016)<br>CHILDREN: Olive and Frankie<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces<br></p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Childhood and 'E.T.'" data-anchor-id=childhood-and-et class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Childhood and 'E.T.'</h2><img alt="drew barrymore looks at the camera while resting her chin on one of her hands, she wears a red t shirt under a blue corduroy jumper, large pink teddy bears surround her" title="Drew Barrymore on set of ’Babes in Toyland’" width=1024 height=706 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-child-actress-drew-barrymore-on-the-set-of-clive-news-photo-1694539884.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>A young Drew Barrymore on the set of Clive Donner’s 1986 television movie Babes in Toyland</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Drew Blythe Barrymore was born on February 22, 1975, in Los Angeles.

She appeared in a television commercial for Puppy Choice dog food before her first birthday. Drew made her big-screen debut at the age of 5 in Ken Russell’s Altered States (1980). At age 7, she landed one of her most famous roles: playing Gertie, the adorable little sister in Spielberg’s E.T.: The Extraterrestrial (1982). The role pushed the young actor into the spotlight. After working on the movie, she appeared on NBC’s The Tonight Show with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/johnny-carson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Johnny Carson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Johnny Carson</a> and became <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/lorne-michaels-saturday-night-live-origins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saturday Night Live" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Saturday Night Live</a>’s youngest guest.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="Playboy Shoot and Troubled Teen Years" data-anchor-id=playboy-shoot-and-troubled-teen-years class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Playboy Shoot and Troubled Teen Years</h2><img alt="drew barrymore, wearing a white shirt, denim jacket and jeans, stands on a beach and looks directly at the camera, smiling" title="Drew Barrymore in March 1992" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-actress-drew-barrymore-news-photo-1694540046.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Drew Barrymore in March 1992</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, Jaid soon began taking her daughter to night clubs, and it was at Studio 54 and the China Club that Barrymore developed a preteen fondness of drugs and alcohol. At 13, an enraged Barrymore became violent when she was unable to throw her mother out of the house. She was placed in a rehabilitation center and later wrote of the experience in her autobiography, Little Girl Lost. At 14, Barrymore <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/25/drew-barrymore-the-day-i-divorced-my-mother data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="became emancipated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">became emancipated</a> from her mother and moved into her own apartment at age 15.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Because of her reputation as a wild child in trouble, movie roles were slow to materialize. Barrymore made some minor films, including Irreconcilable Differences (1984), Firestarter (1984), and Cat’s Eye (1985). In the 1990s, she began starring in a series of films that exploited her bad-girl image, including Poison Ivy (1992), Guncrazy (1992), and The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/amy-fisher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Fisher" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Amy Fisher</a> Story (1993), a made-for-TV movie based on the Joey Buttafuoco scandal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1994, Barrymore entered into a short-lived marriage to bar owner Jeremy Thomas at age 19.
