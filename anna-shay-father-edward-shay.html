His net worth surpassed $1.2 billion, as disclosed after his children sold his shares.</p><p>His daughter Anna Shay currently has a net worth of $600 million. She also earns her own money but appears to be unsure what to do with it.</p><p>Shay’s life’s work enabled him to provide a comfortable existence for his children. Anna even stated that she had never worked in her life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=He_Was_The_Founder_Of_Pacific_Architects_and_Engineers_PAE></span>He Was The Founder Of Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Edward Shay is best known for founding Pacific Architects and Engineers. It is a United States-based defence and government services contractor.</p><p>Shay established the corporation in 1955, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Platinum Equity owned the company from 2016 to 2018, when it debuted on the Nasdaq.</p><p>The company was merged with Amentum Government Services Holdings LLC in February 2022, and its shares were delisted from the Nasdaq. According to Wikipedia, the corporation produced $2.1 billion in revenue in 2016.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Edward_Left_His_Fortune_To_His_Children></span>Edward Left His Fortune To His Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Edward Shay, Anna’s father, formed Pacific Architects and Engineers, which specialised in military armaments and other technology. After his death, he left his company’s shares to Anna and her brother.</p><p>The siblings divided the proceeds from the sale of their interests.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Daughter_Has_A_Wealth_Of_600_Million></span>His Daughter Has A Wealth Of $600 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna is one of the Bling Empire’s wealthiest cast members. She made millions after selling her father’s stake in PAE.</p><p>She has also stated that she has no idea what to do with the money she earns from her position in Bling Empire. As a result, she did not cash the cheques she received, which landed her in hot water.</p><p>She has become a celebrity in addition to her role in the show, and she is reportedly paid roughly USD 1,623 for each post on her Instagram by various sponsors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Businesses_Did_Edward_Shay_Have></span>What Businesses Did Edward Shay Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Edward Shay was a defence contractor for the United States government and the United Nations. In 1955, he established Pacific Architects and Engineers.</p><p>He worked as an engineer in Japan during the occupation. Property development was the company’s first business activity in Japan.</p><p>Shay served as PAE’s chairman, CEO, and sole shareholder until 1974. Things changed when he sold 40% of the company to an employee stock ownership plan.</p><p>The programme returned its shares to Shay in 1988. Following his death in 1995, his son, Allen E. Shay, became chairman and CEO of the corporation. In 2006, Lockheed Martin paid around $1.2 billion in cash for PAE.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sources_Said_PAE_Had_A_Dark_Truth></span>Sources Said PAE Had A Dark Truth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to NBC News, Shay’s company supplied coverage for the Phoenix Program. Furthermore, they claimed that in 1964, the CIA recruited Anna’s father’s company to develop interrogation facilities in South Vietnam.</p><p>Although the operation’s goal was to root out clandestine communist Viet Cong members and their sympathisers, the tactics they adopted resulted in torture and, at times, killings of Vietnamese citizens and others, which is considered the most heinous aspect of the Vietnam War.</p><p>The company today works for NASA and the United Nations, but the truth about the history is still unknown. Both Anna and the corporation declined to respond.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Children_Dissolved_The_Share_Of_PAE_for_12_billion></span>His Children Dissolved The Share Of PAE for $1.2 billion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1995, Shay passed away. He established the company in 1955. His years of hard labour were also beneficial to his children. His five children, Anna and her brother, sold his shares for $1.2 billion in actual cash.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_of_Edward_Shay></span>Family of Edward Shay<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Edward Shay was married to Ai Izumi, a Japanese-Russian. He and she had two children, Anna and Allen. He was a businessman who formed Pacific Architects and Engineers, an American defence and government services contractor.</p><p>There is little information about him on the internet, however he ran the corporation from 1955 until his death in 1995. He left an immense fortune to his wife and children.</p><p>In 2015, His Wife Died</p><p>She was Japanese, but her grandfather was Russian. And, she is reported to be a direct descendant of Japanese nobility.</p><p>She met Edward while he was in Japan during the Allied Occupation. He was, however, her second husband. She had previously been married and had a son named Jun Ai from her prior marriage.</p><p>She was also a businessman and a Second World War survivor. Her ancestors used to trade in pearls and silk flowers. She breathed her last breath in 2015.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Daughter_Is_A_Celebrity_Now></span>His Daughter Is A Celebrity Now<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna claimed that she had never had to work in her life. Her father’s great riches was sufficient for her to maintain her opulent lifestyle.</p><p>Even when she was featured in Bling Empire, she never imagined herself in front of the camera. She described herself as bashful.</p><p>She even stated that the money she was paid by the Bling Empire production should have gone to the crew member who kept up with her during the shooting.</p><p>Despite not having worked for most of her life, she is a well-known philanthropist. She previously served on the board of the George Lopez Foundation, which promotes kidney disease awareness and organ donation.</p><p>She has also worked with the Shay Foundation, which was founded by her late parents. It is concerned with education, the arts, performing arts, and music.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Son_Had_Taken_Over_The_Company_After_His_Demise></span>His Son Had Taken Over The Company After His Demise<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After his death, his son, Allen E. Shay, took over the company. He became chairman and CEO of the corporation. However, he later sold it to Lockheed Martin for a reported $1.2 billion in 2006.</p><p>Anna’s claimed fortune is $600 million, therefore the cash was apparently divided in half between the siblings.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Are Sisi Stringer Parents From Australia?

Anna Shay, the show’s matriarch, strives to teach the younger cast members all she knows. This lady also knows what she’s talking about—there isn’t a better dick out there (sorry, Kelly and Andrew!). Yes, even though it’s been more than a year since she first stated it on the first season of the show, the phrase still works. It’s also one of the numerous phrases that sparked debate over whether Bling Empire was real or fabricated. But we believe it was all Ms. Shay’s fault.</p><p>We didn’t have any more shows like Bling Empire after a long interval. Now that Season 2 of Bling Empire has here, here’s everything you need to know about the stunning and extremely private Anna Shay…</p><p>She has lived for 61 years. She was apparently born in 1960 and will age 60 on December 31, 2020.</p><p>The other cast members, such as Kelly Mi Li, Kevin Kreider, and Kim Lee, are all considerably younger than Anna, thus it stands to reason that they seek her counsel. Maybe not Christine…</p><p>Anna is the daughter of late billionaire American businessman Edward Shay and her Japanese-Russian mother, Ai Oizumi Shay.</p><p>Edward Shay founded the defence firm Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE), which worked for the United Nations and the United States government. He passed away in 1995.</p><p>In an interview with O, The Oprah Magazine, Anna stated that her parents are her heroes: “My father, mother, and son.” My parents are my heroes because they instilled in me the importance of values, integrity, honour, respect, loyalty, and ideals. These are items that are difficult to come by these days.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Anna_Shay%E2%80%99s_net_worth_is_estimated_to_be_at_600_million></span>Anna Shay’s net worth is estimated to be at $600 million.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But, now that she has a Netflix show, we’re sure that number has risen.</p><p>The Shay family’s money has been tied to some of the “ugliest parts” of the Vietnam War. According to NBC, the CIA recruited Anna’s father’s company to develop interrogation centres in South Vietnam in 1964, citing studies from the University of Texas at Dallas.</p><p>“How do we forget this history?” wondered Kimberly Kay Hoang, the University of Chicago’s director of global studies. And why don’t we consider where the money comes from? She can live comfortably in Beverly Hills, but no one ever asks her where she gets her money.</p><p>Anna also discussed her son in an interview with Oprahmag.com, saying that his friends frequently seek her assistance.</p><p>“I need to grow up a little bit,” she told her Bling Empire co-stars. “And, I believe the other performers are sometimes overly serious. I believe our approaches to growing up are also very different. I had to intervene and tell them to stop.</p><p>I’m not here to help them mature. I’m here to make certain that everything is in order. Kenny Kemp, my son, is 27 years old. His friends are continuously asking me what they should do. I’ve always been around children because my mum was always with me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Anna-Shay-1-300x254.png><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_About_Anna_Shay></span>Quick Facts About Anna Shay<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table" style=width:64.6154%;height:240px><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Anna Shay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>60 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother</strong></td><td>Ai Oizumi</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father</strong></td><td>Edward Shay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Son</strong></td><td>Kenny Kemp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$600 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_FAQs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_Anna_Shay%E2%80%99s_father_Edward_Shay%E2%80%99s_net_worth></span>What was Anna Shay’s father Edward Shay’s net worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Anna Shay’s father Edward Shay has a net worth exceeding $1.2 billion.<h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Anna_Shay%E2%80%99s_father_do></span>What did Anna Shay’s father do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Anna Shay’s father was the founder of Pacific Architects and Engineers.<h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Anna_Shay_net_worth></span>What is Anna Shay net worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Anna Shay has a net worth of $600 million. <strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Is Kristin Chenoweth?
