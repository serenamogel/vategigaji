But that all changed this week when Arizona announced that they are revamping the flavor and making it available on their website for a limited time!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-this-tea-taste-like-why-do-i-need-it-why-aren-t-more-beverages-cucumber-flavored-was-arizona-invented-in-arizona>What does this tea taste like? Why do I need it? Why aren’t more beverages cucumber flavored? Was Arizona invented in Arizona?</h2><p>All good questions, let’s start at the top: it allegedly tastes like classic Arizona Tea infused with cucumber. People <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t seem to detect the citrus</a> all that much. That said, the consensus is that it is delicious, refreshing, and just a really good flavor, all in all. As for why more beverages aren’t cucumber flavored, that I am not sure about. It seems like a home run (see: the glorious <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lime cucumber Gatorade</a>), so I think more companies should go for it. In fact, Arizona actually went for it for the first time back in 2017 when they released this flavor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the NYC area</a> with the goal of later releasing it nationwide. Some people reported being able to find it, but it was not on most people’s radars until this week, when Arizona <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced on social media</a> that a 22 oz. Big Can of the flavor would be back and easily purchasable <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on their website</a> for a limited time. In looking at the website, it seems to be a 12-can case for $26.99 (that’s $2.25/can). How limited is this release exactly? We aren’t sure. So, if you need Arizona Green Tea Cucumber with Citrus in your life, I say go snag some now while you still can.</p><p>Now the question you have all been waiting for: Was Arizona Tea invented in Arizona? No, fun fact: it was invented in Brooklyn, New York (the Arizona of the Northeast, some would say).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJminsewusBmnqudlaN6tbHAZpqum6Wir6a%2BjJygraqlqHqvsdasZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./talita-roberta-pereira.html><span>←</span><span>Talita Roberta Pereira Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth</span></a>
