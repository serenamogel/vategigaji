<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Funny Games movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>An even better response, theoretically, would be to storm the booth and rip the film out of the projector, thus symbolically declaring your refusal to swallow the force-fed medicinal doses of synthesized abuse the film is administering. And if you really wanted to ace the challenge, you would just <i>not see the movie</i>.</p><p>But if you liked those pictures from Abu Ghraib, you'll <i>love</i> "Funny Games"! See the captors tighten a pillowcase over a young boy's head, force Mom to strip (no actual nudity shown) by the TV, smash Dad's leg with a golf club and play hide and seek with the body of the family dog they've just killed with the same driver! For the price of a ticket, you can choose the level and nature of your vicarious involvement with the sadism on the screen, and the masochism in your seat. Enjoy.</p><p>The game's narrative parameters are as follows: A dubiously American bourgeois family -- Ann (<a href=#>Naomi Watts</a>), George (<a href=#>Tim Roth</a>), their pre-teen son Georgie (<a href=#>Devon Gearhart</a>) and their golden retriever -- arrive at their vacation home on Long Island. They are upper-class ciphers who stock soy milk in the refrigerator, feed their dog expensive Wellness brand kibble and keep a Tivoli radio in the kitchen. The attention paid to the details of their conspicuous consumption may or may not express the film's attitude: that these cardboard caricatures somehow deserve to be humiliated, tormented and killed for exhibiting Eurocentric yuppie tastes, including implicitly sinful predilections for golf, boating and classical music. Or maybe the movie is simply suggesting that you give yourself permission to feel that way.</p><p>Two symbolic young men, Paul (<a href=#>Michael Pitt</a>) and Peter (Brady Corbett), show up at the screen door, dressed in shorts, canvas shoes, white sweaters and white gloves. They proceed, politely and methodically, to terrorize, torture and murder their hostages, offering a rigged "bet," in the guise of "entertainment," on behalf of the film: that all family members will be dead by a certain hour. Meanwhile, the victims are bludgeoned into submission and despair. The torturers are blandly passive-aggressive and genteel, their motiveless actions appearing alternately logical and irrational, inexorable and impulsive, cruel and -- even more cruelly -- kind. The movie's running time is 1 hour and 52 minutes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46frKemqWK0ornErGRraGBt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-freak-out-over-pride-shirt-in-the-first-episode-of-ms-marvel.html><span>←</span><span>Fans freak out over Pride shirt in the first episode of Ms. Marvel</span></a>
