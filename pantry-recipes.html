It’s thrilling to reach into the cupboard and pull out a can of tomatoes and a bag of dried lentils and imagine what pantry recipes I can make. Flash forward thirty minutes, and they’ve transformed into a creamy curried soup that’s flavorful, comforting, and nourishing.</p><p>It’s certainly been a stressful week for us here in Chicago, and I’m sure it has been for many of you too. When I’m faced with stressful situations, cooking is the first thing I turn to. It’s soothing and meditative – a creative distraction from the buzz of the outside world. If you also find solace in the kitchen, I hope you’ll cook some of these pantry recipes in the coming weeks. They all use simple ingredients like canned goods, dried grains, and long-lasting veggies (plus a few tips for subbing in frozen veggies), but they’re still healthy, delicious, and even fun&nbsp;to eat. Jack and I have made and loved these recipes time and time again, and I hope you love them too.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pantry-recipes/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pantry-recipes-1.jpg&description=30%2B+Healthy+Pantry+Recipes")'></span></span></p><h2>How to Stock a Pantry</h2><p>For me, a well-stocked pantry includes three parts of the kitchen: the cupboard, the fridge, and the freezer:</p><h4>In the cupboard</h4><ul><li><strong>Grains and pasta</strong>: My favorites are whole rolled oats, <a href=#>farro</a>, <a href=#>quinoa</a>, <a href=#>couscous</a>, <a href=#>polenta</a>, and <a href=#>white</a> and <a href=#>brown rice</a>. I also like to keep a few pasta shapes in the cupboard.</li><li><strong>Canned produce:</strong> Whole peeled tomatoes, diced fire roasted tomatoes, and pumpkin puree are my top picks.</li><li><strong>Beans and legumes: </strong>Canned and dried beans and legumes are nutrient powerhouses, and they last for months. Stock up on <a href=#>lentils</a>, chickpeas, beans, and refried beans.</li><li><strong>Fats:</strong> I use extra-virgin olive oil for almost everything, but I also keep coconut oil, toasted sesame oil, and butter on hand. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, and coconut milk are essential fats in my pantry too.</li><li><strong>Dried fruit:&nbsp;</strong>My favorites are dried tart cherries, apricots, and Medjool dates. They’re excellent additions to baking recipes and snacks on their own!</li><li><strong>Baking ingredients and spices:</strong> Sea salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes are a great place to start. If you like baking, keep sugar, brown sugar, chocolate chips, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and active dry yeast on hand as well.</li></ul><h4>In the freezer</h4><ul><li><strong>Frozen vegetables:</strong> Did you know that frozen vegetables are just as – if not more – nutritious than fresh ones? I especially love to add frozen peas, spinach, and corn to soups, salads, and pastas. Frozen berries also work well in smoothies and baking recipes.</li><li><strong>Bread and tortillas: </strong>Bread freezes perfectly, so it never hurts to have one loaf of sandwich bread and one loaf of crusty bread in your freezer. I also like to keep frozen corn and flour tortillas on hand to whip up tacos, enchiladas, or quesadillas any time.</li><li><strong>A few <a href=#>freezer meals</a>:</strong> Soups, stews, veggie patties and balls, casseroles, and baked goods all freeze well. Next time you cook, freeze any leftovers, or make a double batch, and freeze the extras!</li></ul><h4>In the fridge</h4><ul><li><strong>Long-lasting fresh produce:</strong> Potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, cabbage, and root veggies all keep for weeks, so keep a good supply on hand. And of course, you always want to have a stash of lemons or limes in the fridge.</li><li><strong><a href=#>Tofu</a> and <a href=#>tempeh</a>:</strong> Both are excellent sources of plant-based protein, and they have a long shelf life.</li><li><strong>Dairy and eggs:&nbsp;</strong>Cheeses, Greek yogurt, and eggs are all filled with protein and other nutrients, and they keep for several weeks in the fridge.</li><li><strong>Flavorful extras:</strong> Dijon mustard, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, capers, pickled vegetables, tamari, and vinegars. These ingredients will all add extra dimension to your pantry cooking.</li></ul><p>Of course, you don’t need to keep all these ingredients on hand all the time. But with a mix of a few items from each category, you’ll be on your way to making all sorts of delicious pantry recipes. Check out the 30+ ideas below to get started!</p><h2>Bean & Legume Pantry Recipes</h2><p><a href=#><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pantry-recipes/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/lentil-soup.jpg&description=This+curried+tomato+lentil+soup+is+a+warming%2C+healthy+weeknight+dinner%21+It%27s+easy+to+make%2C+filled+with+curried+spices%2C+coconut+milk%2C+diced+tomatoes%2C+lime+%26+ginger.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23lentilsoup+%23soup+%23easyrecipe")'></span></span></a></p><p><a href=#>Lentil Soup</a><br>This curried lentil soup is one of my favorite pantry recipes.
