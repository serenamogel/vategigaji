Every Christmas my Mom would make these for us and they were a treat all five of us kids looked forward to. She would bake them so that one batch was ready right as we were sitting down. She would put the second batch in and they would be hot out of the oven just as the first basket was emptied.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/crescent-rolls-recipe-freshly-baked-733x489.jpg alt=crescent-rolls-recipe-freshly-baked width=733 height=489 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>These crescent rolls are true perfection. Beautiful and golden – they melt in your mouth and are guaranteed to make you smile. I hope you will bake these up and share them with your family this holiday season. Who knows – maybe they will become a tradition for you as well 🙂</p><p>You start by dissolving the yeast in warm water. You want to let it get nice and foamy before adding in the rest of the ingredients. Make sure the eggs and butter are at room temperature!</p><p>I like to use a stand mixer to incorporate all the ingredients but if you don’t have one,&nbsp; you can use a wooden spoon. You’re going to add about half the flour in first. Make sure that it’s completely incorporated before adding in the rest of the flour. You’ll know you’ve added in enough flour when the dough starts pulling away from the bowl.</p><p><h5>free email course</h5><h4><strong>5 SECRETS</strong> TO GETTING DINNER ON THE TABLE...<strong>FAST!</strong></h4></p><p><img decoding=async title="These Homemade Crescent Rolls are so buttery, flaky and totally delicious!

This second rise is where the magic happens so don’t rush it. If you don’t let the rolls rise all the way, they will be a bit denser.

I usually wait until we are literally minutes away from eating before throwing the first batch in the oven. The smell of these crescent rolls works better than a dinner bell any day.</p><p>I keep a close eye on the rolls while they’re baking. Usually I have both ovens going, four burners, etc. and I know that can affect how quickly they bake. I start checking at 10 minutes but they can take up to 14. Be careful, they go from golden to dark fast.</p><p>The rolls are just incredible warm and soft from the oven.</p><p><img decoding=async title="These Homemade Crescent Rolls are so buttery, flaky and totally delicious!
