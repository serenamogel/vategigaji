As the first major-party Black American to run for president, she forged ahead fearlessly, running to represent all the people of the country equally, no matter how they viewed her, as she announced at Brooklyn’s Concord Baptist Church on January 25, 1972, when she declared her candidacy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I am not the candidate of Black America, although I am Black and proud,” the daughter of West Indian immigrants <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/unbought-unbossed-shirley-chisholm-s-lasting-legacy-46-years-later-n840836 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">said</a>. “I am not the candidate of the women’s movement of this country, although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of that… I am the candidate of the people of America. And my presence before you now symbolizes a new era in American political history.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And that was exactly what her historical presidential run did.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Chisholm already made history as the first Black congresswoman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the time Chisholm was putting her hat in the ring for the 1972 Democratic presidential bid along with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/unbought-and-unbossed-when-black-woman-ran-for-the-white-house-180958699/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="white male candidates" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">white male candidates</a> George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey, Edmund Muskie, Henry M.

And in her victory speech, she kept it about the people. “My dear friends, tonight is a very important night… not so much for me, but for you, the people of this community,” she said. “After many years of struggle and sacrifices on the part of several of you here this evening, we have at long last been able to elect today a voice that shall be your voice in the halls of the United States Congress.”</p><img alt="Shirley Chisholm, 1970" title="Shirley Chisholm, 1970" width=3106 height=4606 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-51924073.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Shirley Chisholm, 1970; Photo: Bob Peterson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">She brought her smarts — and sass — to the House</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a newbie to the House of Representatives, Chisholm was assigned to a committee.

But Chisholm wasn’t about to sit around. “They were standing around, peeing on their shoes, so Shirley finally said the hell with it and got a campaign going,” a Chisholm aide told The New York Times. “If she hadn't, we'd still be without a black candidate.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bond responded, “She was absent from most discussions on strategy...We may have been peeing on our shoes, but if we were, she wasn't around to get splashed.”</p><img alt="Poster for presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm" title="Poster for presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm" width=2407 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nmaahc-2014_167_3_001.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Poster for presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm; Photo: Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gifted with pride from Ellen Brooks</span></p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Her campaign was not well received, even by fellow Black politicians</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the campaign was progressing, the Vietnam War was still being fought and the women’s movement was just starting to emerge.
