<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Chop Shop movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Bahrani immersed himself in the Iron Triangle while writing his screenplay. Only one of his actors had ever worked in a movie before; <a href=#>Ahmad Razvi</a>, who plays a shady operator, had been in one, Bahrani's own "<a href=#>Man Push Cart</a>" (2005). Ale's boss, <a href=#>Rob Sowulski</a>, owns and operates the shop where Ale lives. Everyone you see works in the Iron Triangle, except for Ale (<a href=#>Alejandro Polanco</a>) and Isamar (<a href=#>Isamar Gonzales</a>), who are schoolkids. What is remarkable is the way, after careful preparation and multiple takes, Bahrani finds performances in them that are so natural and convincing, they put professional actors to shame.</p><p>He depends on preparation and his visual sense, collaborating always with the same meticulous cinematographer, Michael Simmonds. This month, I joined Bahrani in a shot-by-shot analysis of the film at the University of Colorado at Boulder. It was an illuminating experience. I knew that it was a great film, a universal film and how well it worked. Bahrani knew <i>why</i> it worked, and was brave enough to discuss his methods, which directors are often reluctant to do.</p><p>The screenplay was revised over and again, removing all unnecessary digressions and obvious Look at Me moments. The three-act structure was so deeply embedded in the events, they seemed to flow inevitably. Specific turning points were used in important scenes; sometimes they were no more than a subtle change in tone, but they were emotionally decisive. Much was made of Antonioni painting some grass for "Blow Up," because it was not green enough. Bahrani and Simmonds composed every shot with acute attention to detail. Often foreground elements forced characters toward the left, more problematic, side of the screen. No auto junk in the background was there by chance. In the lighting of faces, they took Bergman's <a href=#>Sven Nykvist</a> as their ideal. There is a pickup truck that has a small sticker of a soccer ball on its back gate. Bahrani and Simmonds discussed whether it should be there: "Was it contributing, or distracting?"</p><p>Although there was rehearsal, he said, he avoided drilling his actors. He told them what to say, and they tended to slip into their own word choices. Ale and Isamar discuss a pair of brand-name sneakers. The screenplay used the word "real." Isamar used the word "official," the correct street word. Some shots were captured unobserved; the movie used no clapboard to begin and end shots, and Bahrani and Simmonds could communicate with a nod or a gesture. The high-def camera was always around, and Simmonds was always peering through it to set up shots; sometimes the actors were unaware they were being filmed. Bahrani also likes long shots with the camera far enough back so it is not evident. As Ale grabs a purse (from a cast member) on a walkway leading to the parking lot, nobody else in the shot knows they are in a movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cn6ioXai1sLyMa2dpcF1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlotte-pence-bond-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-59593-html.html><span>←</span><span>Charlotte Pence Bond Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
