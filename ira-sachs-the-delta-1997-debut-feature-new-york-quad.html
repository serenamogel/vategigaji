One was, it’s very much a classic coming-of-age story in the issues it’s dealing with: an 18-year-old man figuring out who he is sexually and stumbling into the answers. And the other thing is that there are a lot of moments where it reminded me a little bit of “<a href=#>Moonlight</a>.” I wonder if you felt any sort of affinity for that movie? Did it speak to you the way it did other people?</b></p><p>It did, particularly in terms of its understanding and its interest in place and the specificity of a culture, and being located “somewhere,” not nowhere, and not in a place of the imagination. That was central to “The Delta."</p><p><b>The opening shot of Lincoln walking down the road at night: there’s something about the quality of the light and the sounds of the insects at night that took me to the American South. The humidity, the bugs. I grew up in Texas but I had relatives in Arkansas, Alabama and places like that, and all of a sudden, watching that opening, I was back there.</b></p><p>Yeah man! I grew up in Memphis. I don’t think I could make a movie there anymore because it’s been 30+ years since I lived there, and now I lack an intimacy. I’d be an outsider. But at that point, it filled my imagination…Memphis, and the kind of feeling of that place.</p><p>I went back to Memphis after writing an initial, kind of rough outline of the script. I moved there for six months with my producer Margot Bridger, and she and I turned the film into something contemporary, of the moment, because I still had a little bit of distance as someone trying to imagine being a teenager who was then in his late 20s. I was reprogramming that through the people I met, and that world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmprKjZLazrYysmJygo2LBqbGMnZylrJFifnqFlmabnpqlqXqnscCtrKudXaOyuHnYqKmkZaGqrqU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-marsden-says-he-felt-naked-filming-sonic-the-hedgehog-2.html><span>←</span><span>James Marsden says he felt naked filming Sonic the Hedgehog 2</span></a>
