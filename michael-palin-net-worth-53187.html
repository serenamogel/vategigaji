At the same time Palin was contacted by Jones, who had left university a year earlier, for assistance in writing a theatrical documentary about sex through the ages. Although this project was eventually abandoned, it brought Palin and Jones together as a writing duo and led them to write comedy for various BBC programmes, such as <i>The Ken Dodd Show</i>, <i>The Billy Cotton Bandshow</i>, and <i>The Illustrated Weekly Hudd</i>. They collaborated in writing lyrics for an album by Barry Booth called Diversions. They were also in the team of <a href=#>Writers</a> working for <i>The Frost Report</i>, whose other members included Frank Muir, Barry Cryer, <a href=#>Marty Feldman</a>, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, Dick Vosburgh and <a href=#>Future</a> Monty Python members Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle. Although the members of Monty Python had already encountered each other over the years, <i>The Frost Report</i> was the first time all the <a href=#>British</a> members of Monty Python (its sixth member, Terry Gilliam, was at that time an <a href=#>American</a> citizen) worked together. During the run of <i>The Frost Report</i> the Palin/Jones team contributed material to two shows starring John Bird: <i>The Late Show</i> and <i>A series of Bird's</i>. For <i>A series of Bird's</i> the Palin/Jones team had their first experience of writing narrative instead of the short sketches they were accustomed to conceiving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmednrCprcSlZKmZnJ67brrErWSwp6KptW6BkmpvcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristin-chenoweth-husband-is-kristen-married.html><span>←</span><span>Kristin Chenoweth Husband: Is Kristen Married?</span></a>
