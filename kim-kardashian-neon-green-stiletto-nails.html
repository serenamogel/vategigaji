And if you know anything about the multi-faceted mogul and larger-than-life business woman, you know she seldom strays from pinkish neutral tones and naturally short nail lengths when it comes to her manicures ...</p><p>Yet earlier this week while attending the annual Baby2Baby Gala, <a href=# class=T3D>the platinum blonde bombshell donned some seriously sharp stiletto nails</a> with very <a href=# class=T3D>on-trend French tips</a>. And of course: her long nail-loving younger sister Khloé was a major fan to say the least (<a href=# class=T3D>and Kardashian stans were quick to create memes for the monumental moment</a>).</p><p>And just last night, the mom of four arrived at a <a href=# class=T3D>SKKN by KIM</a> pop-up in California dripped in <a href=# class=T3D>futuristic silver hues</a> and an unexpected pop of bright green nails — which just so happened to also be ultra-long and sharp. Kim took to her Instagram stories to share, “Khloé would be so proud of me again, look at the nails. They are just press-ons again. I have the girls paint them and then just put the glue behind it so when I get claustrophobic in the car .... Then they come off and I reuse them.”</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# class=T3D>The Good American founder</a> was quick to respond with her two cents, of course, sharing to her IG stories in all-caps: “I’m so turned on until she says they are press-ons or that she reuses them ... You still make me horny Keeks.”</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Not only is <a href=# class=T3D>Kim experimenting with her look</a> when it comes to her root-y <a href=# class=T3D>platinum blonde</a> (which she admits she plans on keeper a bit longer) — but it seems she is playing with her nails as well, going for longer lengths and more vivid hues than usual. And TBH — her glam <a href=# class=T3D>Grinch moment</a> is very much of the times, as <a href=# class=T3D>green pigments are expected to be a major makeup trend this winter</a>.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07Kjnmebnrput8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nNnqanZZensqa6jKyroqSVqcGwec2aoKWr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aimee-brigg-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Aimee Brigg Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
