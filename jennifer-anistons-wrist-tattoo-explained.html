The number seems to hold a lot of significance for her: her birthday is February 11, and her beloved dog Norman — for whom Aniston got her first tattoo, his name in script on the arch of her foot — died in 2011. While this may be true, it wouldn't necessarily explain the significance for Aniston's bestie and tattoo twin, Andrea Bendewald (pictured above with Aniston).</p><p>Bendewald also appears to be very spiritual, referencing the "New Moon in Aquarius" in her <a href=#>Instagram</a> birthday tribute to Aniston, writing, "Makes sense that the entire Universe would be in alignment with LOVE on your birthday!" Aniston also calls Bendewald her "oldest friend" in a 2019 profile in the <a href=#>New York Times</a>, which said they gather with others regularly for "a goddess circle." <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> takes the idea about the numbers further, saying "double elevens are often referred to as 'angel numbers' in new-agey circles and are considered to be a sign from the universe or guardian angels that you're on the right path."</p><p>But perhaps the strongest meaning behind the tattoos is the fact that the two friends share them. The <a href=#>Mirror</a> calls it "an emblem and celebration of their flourishing friendship," and it's clearly another indication of the love these two hold for each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxpZ4Z4e8mepaehlpq%2Fbq3Noqqtp56oeri%2ByKyrZqyRqcGwu4yer6mkkZ67prCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamilah-lemieux-father-age-wiki-instagram-daughter-and-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Jamilah Lemieux Father: Age, Wiki, Instagram Daughter and Facts</span></a>
