For the uninitiated, a stroopwafel is a Dutch dessert that is essentially like if you took two little circles of waffle cone, and then smushed some caramel between them."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Well, now you can thanks to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heavenfull’s new Stroopwafel Ice Cream Sandwich</a>, available at a Costco near you.&nbsp;</p><p>For the uninitiated, a stroopwafel is a Dutch dessert that is essentially like if you took two little circles of waffle cone, and then smushed some caramel between them. I think they’re absolutely delicious, and that’s coming from someone who has only ever had one on an airplane, so we know it wasn’t the world’s stroopiest wafel. But it was stroopy enough for jazz, and stroopy enough for me to think, “Wow, this lil’ wafel just made my travel experience ten times better.”</p><p>But I digress. The reason why I brought you here today isn’t to talk about my various plane snack escapades, but rather to inform you that this delicious-looking stroopwafel ice cream sandwich features two caramel-filled stroopwafels with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BEST-OREO-FLAVORS_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_HEADER.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-best-oreo-flavors-ranked><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Oreo Flavors, Ranked</a></h2><p class=related-date>March 31, 2022</p><p>We decided it was our&nbsp;Sporked-ly duty as food testers to try all the Oreos and let you know which are worth your while.</p><p>This invention is genius. Why? Because it’s meta every which way from Amsterdam. Not only is it a sandwich made with two sandwiches, but it’s also essentially ice cream sandwiched between two bits of cone and caramel, making it somewhat like an inside-out ice cream cone. It’s how I imagine people who eat their cupcakes by ripping the cake part in half and sticking it on top would approach eating an ice cream cone and I’m here for it.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll definitely be heading down to Costco to try and stroop up some of these wafels before they are all gone. My only concern is the texture of the wafel. Will it have enough give for the ice cream not to unceremoniously flop out the back? The stroopwafel I had on the plane was on the chewy side as opposed to the crunchy side, but again, I was on a plane. I don’t know what fresh wafels taste like. But you can bet your Ass-terdam that I’m about to go to Costco and find out.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>H/T <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mashed</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKukp7ywvNaanZ6kXZ6wpnnCq5yapV2orq%2Bw1qKaoWWTpMC1r85mpZ6vo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-maria-rossing-husband-her-career-and-personal-details-explored.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Maria Rossing Husband?
