He lives a quiet life and hasn't revealed much about himself. His parents seldom post about him on their social media as well so it's hard to learn about his life.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Elijah's Parents, Flex And Shanice</h2><p>Elijah Alexander Knox is still young to be working right now.

The two lived in the same building in San Fernando Valley and one day, they crossed paths when they both had to use an elevator.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though that was Flex and Shanice's first encounter they were aware of each other being a celebrity. That's how they started talking and soon love blossomed between the two.</p><h2>The Financial Struggle Of Elijah's Parents</h2><p>Elijah's parents would have been much richer if the real estate market hadn't crashed during the 2010s. Flex and Shanice almost went bankrupt because of this.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Page Six</i></a> has reported that Flex and Shanice had bought a lot of properties as a long-term investment but the market crash made them poor.

They have dealt with all the highs and lows together. Of course, having no choice but to leave their home due to lack of finances was the worst time of their life.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Flex and Shanice never stopped caring about each other.

She only has one song on her Spotify at the time of this writing called <i>At Your Best (You Are Love)</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides that, Imani&nbsp;is only on TikTok doing a lot of cover songs for fun. Her mother also loves to promote her work through Instagram.</p><h2>Elijah Is Trying To Make A Career In Music</h2><p>Elijah Alexander Knox also wants to make a career in music like his sister, Imani.
