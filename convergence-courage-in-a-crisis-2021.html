Her observation that the pandemic has only added to what people living on the margins are already dealing with is echoed by physician Dr. Armen Henderson at the University of Miami Health System, who aims to help the city’s largely Black homeless populace living in encampments that the government repeatedly destroys. Superbly lensed by <a href=#>Amber Fares</a>, Henderson’s scenes also chillingly portray how he was racially profiled by a white, maskless cop outside of his own house.</p><p>What “Convergence” reinforced for me, more than anything, is simply the overwhelming gratitude I have for every essential worker who took my temperature, bagged my groceries and drove me to my desired destination over the past twenty months. I’ll never forget the benevolent nurse in Cook County who administered both doses of my Pfizer vaccine, nor the sister of a colleague who died after caring for the pet of&nbsp;a client infected with COVID-19 at her veterinary clinic. The client refused to wear a mask, eventually forcing the cancer-stricken veterinarian to quarantine for 25 days without chemo.

Yet the film’s most moving moment of all takes place in Lima, Peru, where&nbsp;Dr. Rosa Luz López cares for a young patient, Aldair, with a refreshing dose of good humor (she refers to her hazmat suit as a “Tellatubby costume”). After Aldair becomes healthy enough to have a tearful reunion with his father, co-directors&nbsp;Lali Houghton and Guillermo Galdos follow López back to her office, where she finally unleashes her tears of gratitude. “I don’t want commendations,” she insists, “I want a better health care system.” The principle of treating others as you wish to be treated is embodied with such radiance by López that it stands as a guiding light for us all.&nbsp;</p><p>Now playing on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cpqeulae0prrCnmScp6WnrqixjKKlZpldmL%2Bqv8isZGtoYmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leaked-lupe-fiasco-songs-lasers.html><span>←</span><span>New Lupe Fiasco Songs Off Of Lasers</span></a>
