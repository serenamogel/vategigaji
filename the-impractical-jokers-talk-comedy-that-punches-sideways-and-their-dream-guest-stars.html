So what exactly fuels the jokers? The answer might not surprise you — it’s being able to poke fun at themselves.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Impractical Jokers (@impracticaljokersofficial)</a></p></figure><p>“It’s the most important thing! We’ve said — like that’s the way because you know, we grew up in the 90s, so things are a little different now. Like, the way we tell each other that we love each other is by making fun of each other. We don’t say nice things to each other when we tell each other that we love each other. We say we don’t punch up we don’t punch down we punch sideways.”</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>The guests on the new season are legends, the guys even called Method Man a hero of theirs for some time now, but they were also asked who they’d love to see on the series in the future. Their answers included Michael Bolton, Bruce Campbell, Jack Black, and Melissa McCarthy. Here’s hoping next season ups the star power even more.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>Of course, Sal, Q, and Murr were also asked about doing this without Joe, and they shared that they talk to him every day, and he’s doing well; he simply needed some extra time off, so he’s taking it. The announcement was made in late 2021 that Joe would not be returning to the Impractical Jokers due to his need to spend some time focusing on changes within his family life.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>While he might be absent from the new episodes, he’s certainly not lacking in their lives. With friendships that span decades, it’s safe to assume that they’ll be friends for life, whether the cameras are rolling or not.</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>You can see new Impractical Jokers episodes beginning Thursday, June 16, on TruTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmoKaoopawtbXCmqNmop%2BgsrO%2FjK2YpaNdmLyuscOyZK2gkal6scHNnJ%2Beq12otqWx1pqwrGWRo7FuwMeeoKtllKeyormMoKyeq6RiwLWt0axm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-delete-or-edit-a-review-on-airbnb.html><span>←</span><span>Can you delete or edit a review on Airbnb?</span></a>
