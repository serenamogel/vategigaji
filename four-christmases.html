We introduce them, they go to the airport, they're on TV, ba-bing, ba-bing, ba-bing.
Cut two ba-bings.&nbsp;What's next?

We'll get <a href=#>Robert Duvall</a>. Mean old snake. Both of Vince's brothers are like extreme duel-to-the-death cage fighters. They beat the crap out of Vince, while ol' dad sits in his easy chair and verbally humiliates him.</p><p>Who are the brothers?</p><p><a href=#>Jon Favreau</a> and <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>.</p><p>Jon Favreau as a cage fighter?</p><p>He got a trainer.</p><p>Does McGraw sing?</p><p>That would slow down the family fight.</p><p>What about Reese?</p><p>Wait until she gets to her mom. Wait until we get to both moms. Her mom is <a href=#>Mary Steenburgen</a>. She's sex hungry. His mom is <a href=#>Sissy Spacek</a>. She's in love with Vince's best friend.</p><p>Those are both good actresses.</p><p>Right, but they can handle this. <a href=#>Jon Voight</a> for Reese's dad. He lives on Lake Tahoe. Perfect for Christmas.</p><p>What's his problem?</p><p>He lends the picture gravitas.</p><p>The audience, does it laugh while his brothers beat the crap out of Vince?</p><p>That's what we're hoping.</p><p>Tell me something else that's funny.</p><p>Two babies who urp on everyone.</p><p>That's funny?</p><p>OK, they projectile vomit.</p><p>A little better.</p><p>Also, we have <a href=#>Dwight Yoakam</a> as Pastor Phil.</p><p>Spare me the religious details. All I want to know is, does Yoakam sing?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>We got two gold-record singers and they don't sing?</p><p>So? We got five Oscar-winning actors, and they don't need to act much. There <i>can't</i> be any singing, boss. If McGraw doesn't sing, then Yoakam doesn't sing. It's in the contract. A most-favored-nations clause.</p><p>Most-favored nations would not even remotely apply here. That is insane.</p><p>There ain't no sanity clause.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46fpq6qXZi1s7XSraSaq5Wo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elohai-neshama-breathing-the-soul-alive.html><span>←</span><span>Elohai Neshama: Breathing the Soul Alive</span></a>
