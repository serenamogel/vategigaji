At one point, Jarrett and Keith tried to buy TNA together, with Jarrett <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">explaining</a> how they first linked up on a recent episode of his My World podcast.</p><p>Toby Keith also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guest hosted WWE RAW</a> in October 2010.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-why-tna-and-toby-keith-didn-t-work-out>Why TNA and Toby Keith didn’t work out</h2><p>Jim Ross previously shared some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a> about Keith’s bid to invest in the company in a blog on his website. According to Ross, Keith wanted full control of the company, which was not something TNA was willing to do.</p><p>“More unsettling rumors rolling out of Nashville regarding the financial health of TNA Impact Wrestling. Apparently a new investor or buyer is at play for the struggling company. Without significant, live event revenue and a viable, PPV component in the revenue mix it will not be surprising to hear of any pro wrestling company being in financial peril. I hope that the eventual fate of TNA is much different than those within the company and others close to the matter are saying. Nonetheless, it is somewhat obvious that the next few months are going to be crucial in determining the future of the company.</p><p>As I’ve said before, it may be best for the company to re-brand themselves and move on from the public perception that the brand currently has in the marketplace. New name..new philosophy..new approach to their presentation based on the talents that they have to work with on a regular basis.</p><p>My Oklahoma friend Toby Keith had a legit interest in buying TNA in the past and he and I discussed my potential involvement of which I was interested working with Toby. He was ready to write a check but he had to have full control with no restrictions regarding creative, etc and that was not on the table.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtaW1sYmLBsK7YZqKeoaSdeqS71Kerq7FdqMGivoyapZ1lpKOubsPWnmSgrZWowW68wKyqnqtdlsSixYyaq2ZuYmKup8DEq2SbmaSpuaZ51qKroWWjqbyurcKhZJyZnpiysw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./penelope-spheeris.html><span>←</span><span>Penelope Spheeris movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
