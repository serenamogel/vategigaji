But, she managed to navigate her way to safety each time until the final four.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Felicia</a> was nominated beside Matt Klotz after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bowie Jane Ball</a> secured the Head of Household key. Later, Jag broke the record for most Power of Veto wins ever by capturing his seventh golden necklace.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>The 25-year-old truck company owner was then faced with a big decision. He had a final three pact with Matt and Bowie Jane, but something that ran deeper was his ride-or-die alliance with Matt. The two formed “The Minutemen” weeks ago following Matt’s decision to nullify Jay’s with his “Power of Invincibility” advantage.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>By winning the Veto, Jag was the only person eligible to vote during Sunday night’s live eviction episode. He had spent the weekend contemplating whether or not he should eliminate Matt, someone he viewed as a massive threat to beat him in the end. Although Jag’s won more competitions, Matt’s social game has been superior while holding the trump card of never being evicted and the sole reason why Jag didn’t walk out the door in week 4.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=117 data-injectable=false>Regardless, Jag chose to stick to his word with Matt and evict Felicia, who had one Head of Household under her belt.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Before heading to the Jury house, Felicia did a media round on Nov. 6. And when speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Felicia said she believed that Jag’s decision to keep Matt over her could potentially be a lifelong regret of his.</p><p>“Jag was supposed to keep me and send Matt to the jury house, and I don’t say that because I was going to stay, but I really believe he made a $750,000 mistake. Him taking the risk of sitting in that chair next to Matt will probably be the decision that he regrets for the rest of his life.”</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Matt has spoken in the Diary Room before about potentially cutting Jag before the final two, but with Jag keeping him around, it’s unclear if Matt would go through with it if he wins the final Head of Household on Nov. 9. And on the other end, Jag has made a deal with Bowie Jane to take each other to the end.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=false>But, if it’s The Minutemen together in front of the Jury, it’ll be interesting to see if Felicia’s gut feeling is right. We’ll know soon enough!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsYymmJ2dXZZ6eIGPaWdpZZ2ewLWtyp5kn52cnrCqrYycmKemn6N6tK3YrGShp6WosqjBxKyrZqWRrnqprdWeZJplnJ6zprjOp55mqpWcv6bAjKitnqpdnbKzecGinmaaoqTBqbHRZmluZZWrtqTAyKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trespassers-2019.html><span>←</span><span>Trespassers movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</span></a>
