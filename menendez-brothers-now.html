They said this abuse, which their mother had been aware of, made them fear for their lives, and that’s why they killed their parents. Their first trial resulted in a deadlocked jury for each brother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lyle and Erik’s second trial began in 1995, this time with just one jury for the both of them. In this joint trial, the judge limited the defense’s ability to introduce sexual abuse allegations. Ultimately, the brothers were each convicted of first-degree murder in 1996. Although the death penalty was a possibility, they each received two consecutive life sentences without parole.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read Their Biographies</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lyle and Erik, who were 21 and 18 years old when they committed the murders, are now 56 and 53, older than their parents ever were. After spending so many years in prison, the two have adapted to the rhythms and rules of incarceration.

However, at the time, prison officials preferred to separate people who’d committed crimes together. In addition, a detective on their case warned that the brothers might plan an escape.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Through the years, Lyle continued to request a placement closer to his brother. On February 22, 2018, he was transferred from northern California’s Mule Creek State Prison to San Diego’s Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, where Erik had been incarcerated since 2013.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lyle initially lived in a different housing unit than Erik at Donovan. But on April 4, 2018, prison officials moved Erik to the same unit as Lyle. According to Robert Rand, a journalist who keeps in contact with the Menendez brothers and members of their family, the two <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/menendez-brothers-burst-tears-emotional-prison-reunion-decades/story?id=54281350" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“burst into tears immediately”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“burst into tears immediately”</a> when they saw each other for the first time since 1996.

In 2005, Erik <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/erik-menendez-the-people-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told People</a>, “I have gotten into fights… many fights. But I never fight first. You have to learn to be smart. There is a perpetual state of fear that exists as background noise. You always have to be aware of who is around you. You have to continually hone your survival instincts.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That said, Lyle and Erik haven’t been regular troublemakers behind bars. The California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation tells Biography.com via email, “During his incarceration, Erik Menendez has incurred two serious rules violations.

This unit, known as Echo Yard, offers inmates more freedom and rehabilitative and educational programming. Echo Yard prisoners take yoga and art classes, study different academic subjects, and join groups to address issues like anger management or alcoholism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Echo Yard is less restrictive, it is still part of a prison. Inmates must stand for regular formal counts. Lyle and Erik live in different dorm rooms with other inmates, and these cells are locked overnight, beginning at 9 p.m.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">What Interests Have the Menendez Brothers Developed in Prison?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Erik has worked with terminally ill inmates. He’s also become interested in meditation and has led classes about religion. In 2018, his aunt <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/deserve-set-free-aunt-menendez-brothers-emotional-reunion/story?id=54295229" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told ABC News" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told ABC News</a>, “[Erik] was really making sure that the prisoners knew that there is a God that loves us. That was marvelous to me because he never got that at home.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Erik has also spent time painting in prison. Together, Erik and Lyle came up with a plan to paint a mural on the concrete walls surrounding Echo Yard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lyle served in inmate government for 15 years at Mule Creek State Prison. According to Robert Rand, Lyle has worked on prison reform, an interest Erik also shares. Both brothers have offered support and guidance to people who experienced childhood sexual abuse.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">How Do the Menendez Brothers Keep in Contact With Friends and Family?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Erik and Lyle are both categorized as Group A prisoners, who have the most privileges to receive visits and make calls within California’s corrections system. For most of their incarceration, making calls from prison was expensive, but in January 2023 telephone calls became free for inmates and their families.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The state of California began providing tablets to prisoners in August 2021, but the devices didn’t reach Donovan inmates until June 2023. The tablets don’t permit access to social media or internet browsers, though inmates can read magazines and keep up with the news. Prisoners can stay in touch with approved contacts via the tablets. In addition to email and free calls, they receive a limited amount of video call minutes and text messages with the option to pay for more.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Both Lyle and Erik Are Married and Met Their Wives While Behind Bars</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Prison hasn’t stopped Lyle and Erik from finding love.</p><img alt="tammi saccoman walks outside and holds a clear satchel full of money, she wears an all white suit" title="Tammi Saccoman, now Tammi Menendez, in June 1999" width=1695 height=2909 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/folsom-ca-exclusive-tammy-saccoman-photographed-at-folsom-news-photo-1706554572.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Tammi Menendez, seen here in June 1999, is the wife of Erik Menendez.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tammi Saccoman watched Erik’s first trial and wrote to him.

It was his second prison wedding; his first marriage to former model Anna Eriksson ended in divorce.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">California prisons permit inmates to have conjugal visits, which are officially known as family visits. Prisoners serving life sentences without parole weren’t eligible for these visits until the law changed in 2016. However, the state continues to prohibit family visits for prisoners who committed a violent offense against a family member, meaning Lyle and Erik remain ineligible for family visits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lyle <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/lyle-menendez-prison-life-separation-brother-erik-menendez/story?id=44405794&" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told ABC News" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told ABC News</a>, “I’ve found I can have a healthy marriage that is complicated and built around conversation and finding creative ways to communicate, sharing, without all the props that are normally there in marriage in terms of going out to dinner and having as much intimate time together and so on.”</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Could the Menendez Brothers Be Released From Prison?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Erik and Lyle filed multiple appeals during their years in prison, but none succeeded, and it seemed they had no viable path to freedom.
