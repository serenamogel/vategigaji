This box office king has portrayed sci-fi characters such a pilot in the Earth invasion flick Independence Day, a disgruntled superhero in Hancock and an alien cop in the comedic Men in Black franchise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Smith was known for his trademark levity due to his days starring in the sitcom Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, some of his sci-fi screen work had more somber tones. He was an alienated police officer in I, Robot, a very loose adaptation of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/writer/isaac-asimov data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Isaac Asimov" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Isaac Asimov</a> stories, and then an alienated scientist in a planet overrun by zombie-like beings in I Am Legend.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He later portrayed an overbearing military father opposite real-life son <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/jaden-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Jaden class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jaden</a> in M. Night Shyamalan's Another Earth. In more recent fare, he played the marksman/assassin Deadshot in 2016’s Suicide Squad and a cop with an orc partner in Bright the following year.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Billy Dee Williams</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Billy Dee Williams got his career underway with tons of TV appearances, including the film Brian’s Song, followed by big-screen dramas opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/diana-ross data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diana Ross" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Diana Ross</a>. A suave paragon, Williams brought that same feeling of debonair smoothness to his role as Lando Calrissian in the 1980 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/filmmaker/george-lucas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Lucas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Lucas</a> blockbuster The Empire Strikes Back. As the administrator of Cloud City and buddy to Han Solo, Williams made rocking a blue tunic with a sweeping complimentary cape look good.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite betraying his allies in Empire, Lando did good and ultimately worked for liberation in Return of the Jedi. The Lando mantle was more recently picked up by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/donald-glover data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Glover" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Glover</a> in the 2018 prequel Solo: A Star Wars Story.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">LeVar Burton</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Known for his starring role in the groundbreaking miniseries Roots, LeVar Burton played engineer Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge in Star Trek: The Next Generation, which debuted in 1987 and ran for seven seasons. He was also a featured player in the big-screen releases that followed in the franchise, including Generations and First Contact.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Burton, who's praised Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry for his vision of inclusivity, has worked behind the scenes as well, directing episodes of Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Enterprise, and Charmed.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Zoe Saldana</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/zoe-saldana data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Zoe Saldana's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Zoe Saldana's</a> career path has seen her featured as a key player in some of the biggest fantastically-themed films of the early 2000s. She appeared as Lt. Uhura in the 2009 J.J. Abrams movie revamp of Star Trek, and later that year was blue-skinned warrior Neytiri in the Avatar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And in yet another coup, in 2014 she started her journey as part of the Marvel Comics universe playing the deadly Gamora, the relatively sane member of the interstellar team known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Saldana’s characters here are known for their fighting spirit and tenacious presence, augmented by her years of training as a dancer.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nichelle Nichols</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A trailblazing actress, Nichelle Nichols portrayed communications officer Lieutenant Nyota Uhura on Star Trek. A member of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 bridge crew, she was part of Gene Roddenberry's progressive vision of a universe where people from all nationalities were deemed as of worth, though Nichols’ role was still contoured in some ways by the gender dynamics of the day. (Women in mini skirts, men in pants.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An accomplished singer and dancer, Nichols at one point was prepared to leave the show to go to Broadway, but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activist/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> asked her to remain, understanding the nationwide impact her role would have. Nichols continued to portray Uhura into the 1990s with Trek movie spinoffs such as The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country, in addition to an array of television roles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the latter part of the 1970s, Nichols took her star power to become a recruiter for NASA, specifically focusing on outreach to women and people of color. Her work led to the recruitment of astronauts like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/astronaut/sally-ride data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sally Ride" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sally Ride</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/astronaut/mae-c-jemison data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mae Jemison" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mae Jemison</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Chadwick Boseman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/chadwick-boseman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chadwick Boseman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chadwick Boseman</a> became part of history as the title character in Black Panther, which was the No. 1 film of 2018. The Panther is the superheroic persona of T’Challa, the ruler of the highly technologically advanced kingdom of Wakanda.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The character is infused with extraordinary strength, sensory perception and agility, and Boseman infused his performance with a high degree of humility, restraint and wisdom.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Michael B. Jordan</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having made his sci-fi stamp in 2015's Fantastic Four revamp, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/michael-b-jordan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael B. Jordan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael B. Jordan</a> entered the world of Wakanda as Killmonger in Black Panther. Killmonger, the movie’s main antagonist, was abandoned by his Wakandan father’s community as a child and left to fester in despair. A vengeance-fueled Killmonger was at the center of the film’s climactic battle, with Jordan infusing the character with an undeniable swag at odds with the traditions of a noble kingdom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Later in 2018, he starred in the TV adaptation of the classic dystopian text about literary censorship and dictatorship, Fahrenheit 451.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Thandie Newton</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thandie Newton is known for her role as Dame Vaako in 2004's The Chronicles of Riddick as well as the title character in the supernatural-themed Beloved.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">More recently, Newton stars as Maeve Millay, a “host,” the term used to describe lifelike robots/androids populating what’s ostensibly an amusement park for violent-minded adults, in the series Westworld. Newton won an Emmy in 2018 for her performance as Maeve.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sonequa Martin-Green</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After several seasons starring as Sasha in The Walking Dead, Sonequa Martin-Green became the first Black woman to be the lead of a Star Trek show when she debuted in the role of Michael Burnham in Discovery. Her human character was raised among Vulcans, thus becoming someone who had to make her way in environments where she wasn’t always readily accepted.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mike Colter</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016, Mike Colter’s star power went mega when he became the title character in the series Luke Cage. The show is based on the Marvel Comics figure Power Man, a hero for hire imbued with super strength and super-tough skin. Colter portrayed Cage as a somewhat temperamental strong man with a big heart who is invested in protecting the community of Harlem from an assortment of criminal plagues.</p><img alt="Zoe Saldana in Avatar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/avatar-zoe-saldana-2009-tm--copyright-20th-century-fox-all-rights-reservedcourtesy-everett-collection.jpg title="Zoe Saldana in Avatar" width=3080 height=2342 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVorqKknGLArrXToWSsm5lis6p5wJyrqKqjYq6kwNGeqqydo2LBt3nMqK2inaM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yasir-al-rumayyan-net-worth-2024-2.html><span>←</span><span>Yasir Al Rumayyan Net Worth 2024</span></a>
