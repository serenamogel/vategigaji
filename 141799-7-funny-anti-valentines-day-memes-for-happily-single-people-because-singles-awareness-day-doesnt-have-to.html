It's not hard to see why <a href=# class=T3D>anti-Valentine's Day memes</a> are so popular this time of year, especially since cynicism is the name of the twentysomething game. But what if you don't have any particularly strong feelings regarding Valentine's Day — or, shockingly, what if you actually enjoy the excuse to pig out on chocolate and wine by yourself? If you're totally single and totally happy, these memes are for you.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>My wallet and I aren't on the best of terms, but it would be so much worse if I wasn't riding solo.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>It's not that difficult to understand.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Ironclad self-esteem is a wonderful thing.</p><p>Valentine's Day is for appreciating those you love, and I love myself.
