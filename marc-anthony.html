His parents, Guillermina and Felipe Muniz, are Puerto Rican and named their son after Marco Antonio Muniz, a Mexican singer who was popular in Puerto Rico.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Marc Anthony grew up in New York City with his sister, Yolanda Muniz. His talent was evident early on; Anthony realized that he had the singing voice, but needed to develop a stage presence to support it. This he did by singing backup as a session vocalist for freestyle and underground New York house music acts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Marc changed his name, to avoid confusion with his namesake, and quickly became an in-demand backup singer; lending his voice to acts such as Menudo and the Latin Rascals.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">First Release</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His first release was a record called "Rebel," which debuted in 1988 from Bluedog Records, based in the Bronx.

In his effort to crossover, it appears that Anthony may have turned away some of his core audience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1998, Anthony appeared with Ruben Blades in Paul Simon's stage musical, The Capeman, which ran for 68 performances.
