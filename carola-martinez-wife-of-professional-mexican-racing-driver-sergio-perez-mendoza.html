Yes, you read it correctly. In August of four years ago, the guy (Sergio) proposed to his future wife.&nbsp;It was unsurprising that the woman accepted the proposal and that the two of them began dating.&nbsp;After a year of planning, the couple announced their wedding date on June 3 and married instantly in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.&nbsp;Furthermore, both of them are Christians, and receiving blessings from Pope Francis is a wonderful way to begin their new adventure.</p><h2>Is it true that the couple had two children after the wedding?</h2><p>The wedding was a success, and it was held in a small, private setting with just close relatives and friends invited.&nbsp;Furthermore, their ceremony was held only a few days following her sister’s special day.&nbsp;The woman is often seen sharing their photos to the social media site, which is rather intriguing in the sense that we can receive an update on their lives.&nbsp;Yes, they have two children, one boy, and one daughter.&nbsp;They called their kid Sergio Perez Jr. after his father’s name.&nbsp;He was born in December 2017, while their daughter Carlota was born two years later in 2019.&nbsp;Carola is regularly seen on the track with her son Perez Jr. to support Sergio in F1 races.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Carola-Martinez-1.jpg><h2>Carola’s spouse has previously dated these females.</h2><p>Carola, on the other hand, had kept her life quiet until she met Sergio. But did you know Carola isn’t her husband’s first love? Yes, you read it correctly. Before tying the knot with Carola, the guy (Sergio) dated a few girls. Starting with the woman, Greta Farias was one of the women he met in 2010. Their romance lasted almost two years before ending in 2012. Then there’s Fernanda Gallegos, whom he dated in 2013. In 2014, he was dating Andrea Campillo Vivanco after a year. Sergio prefers to keep his personal life out of the spotlight. Therefore, no comprehensive history of their relationship is available.</p><h2>Who is there in Sergio’s family?</h2><p>Everyone knows his professional background, and we get glimpses of his family members. Sergio, on the other hand, is the family’s youngest member. He is the son of Antonio Perez Garibay (father) and Marilu Mendoza de Perez (mother). Perez has two elder siblings: Antonio, his brother, and Paola, his sister. Except for the fact that she was the head of the Checo Perez organization, which supports children and orphans suffering from “Cancer,” no specific information about his sister is available.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Carola-Martinez-2.jpg><p>His sibling works in the same industry as his younger brother.&nbsp;Yes, Antonio is a former stock car racing driver who served in the NASCAR Mexico Series and competed in it.&nbsp;Both brothers have one thing in common: they are both football lovers.&nbsp;Furthermore, they considered abandoning auto racing to play at one point in time.&nbsp;Perez also said that if he had not selected this present sector, he would prefer to work in the legal field as a lawyer.</p><h2>Carola Martinez Net worth in 2023</h2><p>Carola’s net worth is unknown, although her husband,<strong> Sergio Perez, is thought to be around $30 million as of on October 2023.</strong></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqqfoa5uucCrq6Kmla96uLXFnmSonl2lv7CyxKyqoqeelrluucSxoJyZnmK%2Foq%2FIp55mnKKew6a%2BjKycq5%2BZpHqxsdGesWallaOxsMbAaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-chiklis-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Chiklis Wife Michelle Morn Chiklis And Family With Two Daughters</span></a>
