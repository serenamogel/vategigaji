In 1866 Custer joined the 7th Cavalry in Kansas, and on June 25, 1876, he led 210 men against Lakota and Cheyenne warriors at the Battle of Little Bighorn, where he and all of his men were killed.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">George Armstrong Custer was born December 5, 1839, in New Rumley, Ohio. One of five children, at a young age he was sent to live with an older half-sister and brother-in-law in Monroe, Michigan, and spent much of his youth bouncing between the two states. After high school, he attended the McNeely Normal School and worked odd jobs to help pay his way, eventually earning a teaching certificate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Custer had greater ambitions than being a grammar school teacher and soon set his sights on the military academy at West Point. While he lacked the qualifications that many of the other candidates had, his confidence eventually won over a local congressman, and with his recommendation, in 1857 Custer was enrolled at the school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But West Point was not a perfect fit for Custer, who, though he longed to climb to a higher rank in life, possessed a deep rebellious streak. A poor student prone to misbehavior, he was frequently disciplined, nearly expelled and ultimately finished last in his graduating class in June 1861.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Compounding his poor academic showing, just a few days after graduation, Custer failed as officer of the guard to prevent a fight between two cadets. Nearly court-martialed in the aftermath, Custer was ultimately saved by the outbreak of the Civil War and the desperate need for officers.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Military Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Custer was placed in command of a cavalry unit as a second lieutenant, and in July 1861 quickly earned recognition for himself with his brilliant direction of its actions at the First Battle of Bull Run. He also seemed to possess a gift for avoiding injury, which he came to call "Custer's luck." (Unfortunately, the men under his command weren't always so lucky, suffering disproportionately high casualties during the war.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having only recently been an unremarkable student, with his brave actions at Bull Run and elsewhere Custer soon earned the positive attention of high-ranking officers and earned himself an assignment to General George B. McClellan's staff. In turn, the visibility of that post led to his promotion to brigadier general in 1863.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Boy General</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Placed in command of the Michigan Cavalry Brigade, over the next few years Custer distinguished himself at such important battles as Gettysburg and Yellow Tavern and earned himself the nickname "Boy General," in reference to his relatively young age. "Future writers of fiction will find in Brigadier General Custer most of the qualities which go to make up a first-class hero," gushed the New York Tribune in 1864.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the war's end, Custer had been promoted yet again, to the rank of major general, and his cavalry units were crucial in blocking the movements of Confederate General <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/military-figures/robert-e-lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert E. Lee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert E. Lee</a>'s retreating forces, which helped hasten his surrender at Appomattox, on April 9, 1865.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In recognition of his heroism, Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan gave the young military hero the table used to sign the war's peace terms, including with it a note to Custer's wife, Libbie, in praise of her husband. "Permit me to say, Madam," he wrote, "that there is scarcely an individual in our service who has contributed more to bring about this desirable result than your gallant husband."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Battle of Little Bighorn</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the war, as the still-young country looked to settle the West, it needed to defeat the Lakota Sioux and Southern Cheyenne that dominated parts of the frontier. To that end, the 7th Cavalry was created and Custer was placed in its command. After serving a brief suspension for deserting his post in 1867, Custer returned to action the following year and participated in several small battles against Native Americans in the region over the next several years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Custer's legendary bravery in battle would prove to be his undoing when, in 1876, the United States ordered an attack intended to crush the Lakota and Cheyenne. Though the plan was for three separate forces—one of which was led by Custer—to surround and overwhelm them, Custer and his men advanced more quickly than the other two units, and on June 25 Custer ordered his 210 men to attack a large Native American village.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the other side of the attack was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/sitting-bull data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sitting Bull" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sitting Bull</a>, the revered Lakota chief who had originally wanted peace at Little Bighorn. Custer, however, was determined to fight. Against the onrush of thousands of Lakota, Arapaho and Cheyenne warriors, Custer and all of his men were surrounded, overwhelmed and killed.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Custer's Last Stand and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Battle of Little Bighorn was a stinging embarrassment to the U.S. government, which redoubled its efforts and quickly and cruelly defeated the Lakota.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For his role in the battle, Custer earned himself his place in American history, though certainly not in the way he would have wished for. During her final years, Custer's wife wrote accounts of her husband's life that cast him in a heroic light, but no story could overcome the debacle that became known as Custer's Last Stand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2018, Heritage Auctions announced that it had sold a lock of Custer's hair for $12,500. The lock came from the collection of artist and American West enthusiast Glen Swanson, who said that it was preserved when Custer saved his hair following a trip to the barber, in case he needed a wig.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: George Custer</li><li>Birth Year: 1839</li><li>Birth date: December 5, 1839</li><li>Birth State: Ohio</li><li>Birth City: New Rumley</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: George Custer was an American cavalry commander who in 1876 led 210 men to their deaths at the Battle of Little Bighorn.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>U.S. Military Academy at West Point</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1876</li><li>Death date: June 25, 1876</li><li>Death State: Montana</li><li>Death City: Little Bighorn River</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=38><ul data-node-id=40 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: George Custer Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/military-figures/george-custer</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 19, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=43 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I would be willing, yes glad, to see a battle every day during my life.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikoqSZqa6zxYyfoKCtoprAcLPEqKmgnV2YwrTAxKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-horn-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Horns biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
