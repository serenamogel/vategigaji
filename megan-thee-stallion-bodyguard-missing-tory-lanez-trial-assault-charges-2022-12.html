"Law enforcement is investigating the matter," he added.</p><p>Edison's last post on <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> is dated December 2. Besides working as a bodyguard, he is a certified physical trainer, according to his page. Details surrounding when and where he was last seen are not clear.</p><p>The Los Angeles District Attorney's office has <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>accused Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson,</a> of shooting Megan <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>in the feet</a> after a small gathering at Kylie Jenner's house during the early morning hours of July 12, 2020. The "Luv" rapper has denied shooting Megan, whose real name is Megan Pete. The other two individuals present during the incident were <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Kelsey Harris, Megan's ex-best friend and former assistant,</a> and Lanez's driver, Jauquan Smith.</p><p>The prosecutors and the defense team agree that an argument ensued in the car when the group left Jenner's house, though they gave conflicting descriptions.&nbsp;</p><p>While Edison was not present the night of the conflict, Harris texted him from the car: &nbsp;"Help. Tory shot Meg. 911," prosecutors said in court this week.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the shooting, Edison went to Lanez's home to pick up Megan's belongings, Deputy District Attorney Alexander Bott said during opening statements on Monday. Bott said Edison told prosecutors that Lanez' confessed to being "too drunk" and shooting in the air and at the ground the night of the incident.</p><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèæ‚úäüèø (@justwatchprotection)</p><p>Lanez was charged with assault with a semiautomatic firearm, personal use of a firearm, and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle.

If convicted, Lanez faces up to 22 years in prison.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Megan testified on Tuesday</a> that Lanez shot her. She said she initially lied about the incident because of her fear and distrust of the police and because <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>she didn't think the "big boy's club" music industry</a> would believe her.&nbsp;</p><p>"When I get out the car, I hear Tory say 'Dance, bitch,'" Megan said in her testimony, adding that gunfire started immediately. "I froze. I'm in shock, I'm scared. <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>I can't believe he's shooting</a> at me."</p><p>The trial is set to resume on Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>The LAPD and the LA District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
