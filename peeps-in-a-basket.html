I used Wilton Gel Food Colors and loved how they turned out! Of course sweet little nests are all well and good but we wanted something to carry the little nests in so we made miniature Easter baskets using cupcake liners and, possibly my favorite craft supply EVER, pipe cleaners! Simply poke the pipe cleaner through one side of the “basket” and push through about 1.5 inches of pipe cleaner. Twist it around the handle portion of the basket. Repeat on the other side.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/baskets-for-peeps.jpg alt=baskets-for-peeps width=800 height=573 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>To make the nests:</p><p><h5>free email course</h5><h4><strong>5 SECRETS</strong> TO GETTING DINNER ON THE TABLE...<strong>FAST!</strong></h4></p><p>Melt 16 oz of vanilla flavored candy coating {I used CandiQuik} according to package instructions. If you are making multiple colors, divide the melted candy into an appropriate number of bowls. Add food color to achieve your desired color before mixing in coconut. I used a 14 oz bag of coconut for 16 oz of candy coating. Stir the coconut in until fully coated.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Peep-Baskets.jpg alt="Peep Baskets" width=400 height=" " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto waxed paper and use a spoon or your thumb to make indentations.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/colored-coconut-nests.jpg alt=www.MomOnTimeout.com width=800 height=534 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Let nests harden before filling with jelly beans and topping with your favorite Peeps.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Peeps in a Basket | MomOnTimeout.com - Peeps are nestled in a coconut nest and placed in a cupcake liner basket.
