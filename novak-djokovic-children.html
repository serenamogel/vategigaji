While some argue he deserves the title, others hesitate to endorse it fully.</p><p>They believe that players like Federer deserve equal recognition. However, it’s essential to question whether numbers alone define greatness.</p><p>Suppose an imaginary player who is 10 feet tall, serves aces consistently, and wins 30 grand slams. Would they be the GOAT? No, such a notion is ridiculous.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, imagine a world war where a player named Dave wins 30 grand slams.&nbsp;</p><p>Would Dave be the greatest? Not. Determining the GOAT involves more than statistics or circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>Djokovic’s achievements are remarkable, but the title of GOAT is subjective and complex.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Novak Djokovic children</h2><p>Novak Djokovic and his wife, Jelena, are proud parents of two children.
