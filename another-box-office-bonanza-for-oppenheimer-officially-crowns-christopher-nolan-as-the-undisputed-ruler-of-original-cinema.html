Under most circumstance, a three-hour R-rated period piece that’s basically nothing but people talking in various rooms doesn’t sound as though it’ll become a cinematic sensation, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but Oppenheimer has only gone and passed $600 million globally this weekend</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/oppenheimer-4.jpg><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>As a result, Nolan has become the first director in history to helm four original projects that aren’t sequels, remakes, reboots, or comic book adaptations that earned over $500 million worldwide, taking him above no less of a titanic trio than James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, and Roland Emmerich to place him as the undisputed ruler of successful storytelling that hasn’t been seen before. Unless you want to split hairs and say War of the Worlds isn’t a remake, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it’s the second major movie based on the book following the 1953 original</a>.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>If you’re not in the mood for nitpicking, then Nolan reigns supreme, and he’ll only extend his lead in the future given that his IP days seem to be behind him, unless somebody comes to him with an adaptation he simply can’t refuse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKenpJ2ys3nBqK9mp5abtqSxjJump5mer65uss6rZKiooJq7qbHIppyrZZ%2Bbs6qvyJqjpbFdmL%2Bww82sZJygop7AtbvPoZyrZZ6kuaK6jJqqZqyYmnq2usOiqqmtpJqxbr7UpZyrZZ%2BberC%2ByKCgp5mcYrCqusSmmGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./weepinbell-pok-c3-a9mon.html><span>←</span><span>Weepinbell (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
