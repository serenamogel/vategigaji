I wasn’t afraid to outwork everybody. I outworked those guys.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“While Tupac and all those guys were partying, playing, and just having fun on the road, I was in the studio working. I said, ‘While they sleep, I’m going to be working.’”</p><p>Meanwhile, Compton rapper <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>YG</a> has already found who he believes is the next in line to follow the footsteps of Pac. Sacramento rapper <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Mozzy</a> and YG teamed for the joint effort Kommunity Service in May and just ahead of Mozzy’s Untreated Trauma album release on September 17, the rapper released a video for the lead single “Straight To 4th.”</p><p></p><p>The Suj directed video finds Mozzy in a familiar element of storytelling, reminiscing on a late friend while surrounding himself with others holding on to similar levels of grief.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/08/200821-2Pac-Tupac-Shakur.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>2Pac Murder Investigation Called 'A Waste Of Time' As 25th Death Anniversary Approaches</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>September 8, 2021</p></a><p>The murder investigation surrounding 2Pac has been cloudy, not long after being shot along the Las Vegas Strip on September 7, 1996. After Pac succumbed to his wounds six days later, many pointed towards an incident inside the MGM Grand Garden Casino in which Pac fought with Southside Crips in retaliation for a stolen Death Row chain.</p><p>Although the late Orlando Anderson is widely believed to be the triggerman in the shooting and his <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>uncle Duane “Keefe D” Davis</a> confessed to being an accomplice, Las Vegas Police determined the case would not be worth the time due to Davis’ battling cancer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmaYF3hY6toK2klWPGqHnCmqOlq12ivLvG2GaroZ1do7K4eZGpmJxlkah6rq3SrZyrZaBiv6avwKWjrGWfqsG4u9GkoKefXaGutbGMq5ipZZyatKa6ww%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-impractical-jokers-talk-comedy-that-punches-sideways-and-their-dream-guest-stars.html><span>←</span><span>The Impractical Jokers talk comedy that punches sideways and their dream guest stars</span></a>
