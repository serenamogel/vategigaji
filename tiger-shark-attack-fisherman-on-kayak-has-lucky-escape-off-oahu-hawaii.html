Then out of nowhere this thing just came at me and had a go at the kayak.</p><p>“It looked at me, I looked at it and I thought ‘Oh s***’. I’d given this guy a hard time. He was angry.”</p><p>After Mike cut his fishing line the shark swam away, but the 60-year-old later discovered bite marks in the keel and the top of his kayak - as well as three teeth shards embedded in the vessel.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Department of Conservation marine scientist Clinton Duffy later confirmed the fragments belonged to a great white.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/bwMcSyFaeXVDEQXuYLk9-N9zJQ8=/16x10/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/KQJHLX5SL5E3DOWYRYTOOAZLHA.JPG"><p>Great whites - mostly juveniles - have been reported fairly regularly around Bowentown channel and harbour for the past four or five years, Duffy said at the time.</p><p>Shark scientist Dr Riley Elliot last year began a research project to track and satellite-tag 20 great whites, allowing people to see where the creatures are travelling live on the “Great White App”, including in the Bowentown area.</p><p>The incident involving Mike occurred three days before Kaelah Marlow, 19, was killed by a shark while swimming at nearby Waihī Beach. Her death came almost eight years after swimmer Adam Strange, 47, was killed in an attack involving several sharks at Muriwai Beach in West Auckland.</p><p>And in 2009, Waikato man Maurice Philips was mauled by a great white shark after he fell from a kayak on a fishing trip near Clark Island, Coromandel Peninsula.</p><p>However, a coroner wasn’t able to determine if the 24-year-old from Ngāruawāhia was attacked by the shark before or after he drowned.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Over the past 170 years, 13 people have lost their lives in shark attacks across New Zealand.</p><p>While around 66 shark species have been identified living in our surrounding seas, there are around a dozen that fishers and swimmers will regularly come across - with the warmer water-preferring tiger shark not among them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/O-7rfK7-kejasBrZfxpGBfztAzY=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PC2WE6E3GRI6UTZ5TU27VIGSKQ.jpg"><p>Only a handful of sharks that frequent our waters, such as the great white, mako and hammerhead, pose a threat to human life.</p><p>Sharks are in most of the waters around New Zealand and are drawn to harbours to feed, Duffy said in 2021.</p><p>“They’ve always been there.
