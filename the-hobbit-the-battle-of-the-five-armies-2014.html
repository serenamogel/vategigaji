The novel is concise, humorous, with a dark periphery, and even in the midst of extremely tense moments, we have Bilbo, a tut-tutting little homebody, wondering how the heck he got involved in all of this nonsense in the first place. There's not enough Bilbo in "The Battle of the Five Armies." The story misses his presence. The film's first mildly humorous moment, a line reading from <a href=#>Martin Freeman</a>, comes almost 40 minutes in, and it's refreshing, but it highlights the humorlessness of the rest. There are some wonderful sequences in "Battle of the Five Armies", and the attention to detail is breathtaking (each different space rendered with thrilling complexity), but the film feels more like a long drawn-out closing paragraph rather than (like "The Desolation of Smaug") a vibrant stand-alone piece of the story.</span></p><p><span>"The Battle of the Five Armies" picks up where "Desolation of Smaug" left off: Smaug the dragon (voiced by <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch</a>) has burst free into the air, and descends onto the helpless people of Laketown in a blitzkrieg of fire. Bard (<a href=#>Luke Evans</a>) becomes the natural leader of the traumatized refugees, who straggle around dazed at the destruction of their homes. An endless line of devastated people trail up the dizzying slopes towards the Lonely Mountain, where they hope to receive compensation for all they have lost. Meanwhile, the Dwarf contingency, along with Bilbo, hole themselves up in the Mountain, protecting the treasure, most of the dwarves uneasy about the increasingly paranoid leadership of Thorin (<a href=#>Richard Armitage</a>).</span></p><p><span><a href=#>Christopher Lee</a> and <a href=#>Cate Blanchett</a> return, briefly, for a psychedelic scene of mortal combat with the ring wraiths that doesn't seem to have much to do with anything (although it is clearly supposed to be important), and Gandalf (Ian McKellan) returns from imprisonment to the field of battle. Tauriel the elf (<a href=#>Evangeline Lilly</a>) is not given much to do, except love a dwarf, a big no-no in her world. She speaks about love repeatedly, softly and wondrously, and every time she does the entire film deflates en masse. Romantic love has nothing to do with the story overall, and the love subplot feels so obligatory that it's practically condescending.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lmKSvo7XTZquhnV2XrrXAy55kqJ5dqbWmecWirZ5lkae6qrHSZmlpaWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacques-louis-david.html><span>←</span><span>Jacques-Louis David - Art, Napoleon &amp;amp; Facts</span></a>
