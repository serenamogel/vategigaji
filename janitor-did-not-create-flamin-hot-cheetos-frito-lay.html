I’ll be surprised if it was this same ingredient, but it could have been, I guess,” he said.</p><p>Montañez didn’t respond to requests for comment, the newspaper reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Richard-Montanez-flamin-hot-083.jpg><p>The company’s investigation, however, led it to conclude that the snack was “created by a team of people” and “as with all of our products, we do not credit one person with a product invention or flavor extension,” according to internal emails obtained by the newspaper.</p><p>“We value Richard’s many contributions to our company, especially his insights into Hispanic consumers, but we do not credit the creation of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos or any Flamin’ Hot products to him,” the company said in a statement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j25mam5fn66vtdOoqWacmZl6r7vTZpqrnZGpsm6yy5qkoqZdnby1ecKhnJ6sn6h6p77IraZmpJGufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dua-lipa-debuts-new-platinum-blonde-look-at-2022-grammys.html><span>←</span><span>Dua Lipa debuts new platinum blonde look at 2022 Grammys</span></a>
