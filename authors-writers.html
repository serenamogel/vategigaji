Inspired by a dream, she wrote the first book and attracted the attention of agent Jodi Reamer, who secured her a three-book publishing deal. The books have sold more than 250 million copies, been translated into 37 languages and adapted for a five-part hit film series. Meyer has also published the novels The Host (2008) and The Chemist (2016) and launched her own film production company.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meyer was born Stephenie Morgan on December 24, 1973, in Hartford, Connecticut, to Stephen and Candy Morgan. Meyer has called the uncommon spelling of her first name "a gift from [her] father," who added the letters "i" and "e" to the end of his name to create "Stephenie."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Four years after Meyer's birth, her family relocated to Phoenix, Arizona. As the second of six children, Meyer took on the duties associated with being an elder sibling in a large Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints family. Between caring for her younger brothers and sisters, she developed a passion for reading, becoming an avid fan of classic authors <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/jane-austen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jane Austen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jane Austen</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/charlotte-bronte data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charlotte Bronte" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charlotte Bronte</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/margaret-mitchell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Margaret Mitchell" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Margaret Mitchell</a>, among others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though Meyer felt out of place among the privileged population of Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, she was an excellent student. Graduating from the school in 1992, her high marks earned her a National Merit Scholarship. She used the award to attend Brigham Young University, where she majored in English literature.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage and Family</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1996, between her junior and senior years at Brigham Young, Meyer became re-acquainted with childhood friend Christian "Pancho" Meyer (the two had grown up in the same social circles). The reunited friends soon began dating and were married less than a year later, when Meyer was just 21 years old. Meyer graduated from Brigham Young University in 1997. That same year, she gave birth to her first son, Gabe. Sons Seth and Eli followed, and Meyer experienced a busy life as a stay-at-home mom.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Inspiration for 'Twilight'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On June 2, 2003, Meyer became an author in earnest. Following a compelling dream — the inspiration for the Twilight book series, and the basis for Chapter 13 of its first book — Meyer began a frenzied writing spree. The series' early chapters explored the romance between Edward Cullen, a vampire, and Bella Swan, a human girl. Influenced by authors like William Goldman, Orson Scott Card and Douglas Adams, Meyer worked diligently to flesh out the story, often writing while her children slept.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Within three months, Meyer had created a 500-page manuscript and begun searching for a publishing contact. Using advice taken from author Janet Evanovich's website, she was eventually contacted by Jodi Reamer, a literary agent at Writers House. Reamer and Meyer worked together to polish the manuscript — among other things, Reamer insisted that Meyer change her first title, Forks, to the current title — and the book was soon presented to publishing houses. Not long after, Reamer secured a three-book deal from Little, Brown and Company, which included a $750,000 advance — the highest sum the publishing house had ever paid a new writer at the time.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Commercial Success and 'Twilight' Films</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Twilight was released in 2005 to rave reviews, quickly becoming a best seller. An active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Meyer had eschewed strong sexuality in her writing, supplanting it with florid sensuality — a draw for her numerous (and primarily female) readers. Like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/jk-rowling data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="J.K. Rowling" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">J.K. Rowling</a>'s Harry Potter franchise, Meyer's book bridged the gap between teen and adult fiction. She also increased her popularity through her online accessibility and frequently made herself available to her fan base.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Twilight was honored as a New York Times Editor's Choice and as Publishers Weekly's Best Book of the Year. The following year, Meyer published her sophomore effort, the sequel New Moon, and sold the film rights to Twilight. With the third and fourth installments, Eclipse (2007) and Breaking Dawn (2008), Meyer's series has sold more 250 million copies and has been translated into 37 languages.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The books were also adapted for a film series amassing five installments, including The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 2, released in November 2012. Grossing more than $3 billion globally, the Twilight film series stars <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kristen-stewart data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kristen Stewart" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kristen Stewart</a> (Bella Swan), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-pattinson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Pattinson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Pattinson</a> (Edward Cullen) and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/taylor-lautner data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Taylor Lautner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Taylor Lautner</a> (Jacob Black).</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Midnight Sun'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 2020, following a dramatic countdown on her website, Meyer announced that she was publishing the long-awaited Midnight Sun, a retelling of the Twilight story from Edward's perspective. The author had abandoned the project after the manuscript was leaked online in 2008, before resuming work on it years later.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">More Books: 'The Host' and 'The Chemist'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2008, Meyer released her first non-Twilight work: The Host focuses on a race of parasitic beings that have invaded most of the humans on Earth, and one girl's ability to fight off — and then bond with — her invading soul. While not achieving the immense commercial success of the Twilight books, The Host landed on the Times' best-seller list and was translated into multiple languages.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The author took another emphatic step away from the YA genre with the 2016 publication of The Chemist, about a terrorist interrogator who finds herself on the run from the shadowy government organization that once relied on her unique skills.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Fickle Fish Films Production Company</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, Meyer founded Fickle Fish Films with partner Meghan Hibbett as a means for bringing literature-based screen projects to life. In 2013, Fickle Fish was behind the film adaptation of Meyer's The Host, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/saoirse-ronan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saoirse Ronan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Saoirse Ronan</a> starring as Melanie Stryder, as well as an adaptation of Shannon Hale's 2007 novel Austenland, featuring Keri Russell.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2018, it was reported that Fickle Fish was teaming with Tomorrow Studios to turn The Chemist into a TV series.</p><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Meyer</li><li>Birth Year: 1973</li><li>Birth date: December 24, 1973</li><li>Birth State: Connecticut</li><li>Birth City: Hartford</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Stephenie Meyer is best known for authoring the best-selling 'Twilight' book series, which was adapted into a hit film franchise.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Fiction and Poetry</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Capricorn</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Brigham Young University</li><li>Chaparral High School</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=32><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Stephenie Meyer Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/stephenie-meyer</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 13, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYrqyYpL%2B0edaroK2doqh8tMDEqZ%2Beppmaeq6x2J6p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shannon-chan-kent.html><span>←</span><span>Shannon Chan-Kent Gallery</span></a>
