It has all the best parts of stuffed bell peppers ‚Äì a fresh, flavorful filling, fun garnishes, and juicy roasted peppers ‚Äì but the poblanos add an extra layer of heat. The whole thing is super fresh, super flavorful, and really darn fun to eat. If you‚Äôve never cooked with poblano peppers before, they‚Äôre a chili pepper with a mild to medium heat level. On the Scoville scale, which measures how spicy peppers are, they range from 1,000 to 2,000 Scoville heat units. For context, bell peppers score‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This is one of those ‚Äúit‚Äôs good to be home‚Äù meals.&nbsp;I love vacation, and I love eating out, but after traveling for awhile, I just can‚Äôt wait to&nbsp;get home and get back to my regular healthy eating routine. You know, the one that includes a morning smoothie instead of a croissant, and light vegetable-packed&nbsp;dinners like this one instead of multi-course dinners with wine pairings. Not that I‚Äôm complaining AT ALL, btw‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs time to get back on track and I‚Äôm doing that by&nbsp;eating the rainbow: We‚Äôre partnering with Almond Breeze as part of their Serve Up Your Best campaign.‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>According to my Instagram feed, you all celebrated this past holiday weekend by eating watermelon, making pie, or grilling up corn on the cob. If you were part of the third&nbsp;group, this corn salad is a super easy, super delicious recipe you can toss together if you happen to have leftover grilled corn. And if you don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. well, it‚Äôs still easy nonetheless and it‚Äôll become your favorite summer corn salad. Corn Salad Recipe Ingredients This summer corn salad brings together my favorite summer ingredients to create a refreshingly sweet, crispy, crunchy, creamy combo that&nbsp;I&nbsp;will most definitely&nbsp;be eating all summer long.‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy long weekend! I hope you all have some exciting 4th of July plans! And what I really mean by that is I hope you have more exciting plans than we do. We‚Äôre pretty jet lagged so we‚Äôll probably be celebrating the red white and blue on the sofa with some Orange is the New Black. However,&nbsp;if I DO get up the energy to cook, I think this would be such a delicious veggie-forward summer menu: Pictured above: Baby Bella Veggie Kabobs Watermelon St. Germain Cocktails / Tomato Basil Peach Skewers Vegetarian Orzo Stuffed Peppers Chile Lime Grilled Corn on‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Happy almost-fourth of July! After traveling through Europe for nearly a month, Jack and&nbsp;I are ready to celebrate the USA by, well, sleeping and probably sleeping some more. We don‚Äôt have any big weekend plans, but we‚Äôll probably be firing up the grill at least once or twice, especially to make this creamy & spicy grilled corn on the cob. Corn isn‚Äôt&nbsp;exactly a‚Ä¶ featured ingredient in France, Norway, or Denmark.&nbsp;It‚Äôs good to be home.

The trip was so packed that I decided to break this into two posts. If you missed part one, click here. If you‚Äôre planning a trip to the south of France, I hope you find these posts helpful! Day 4: After a lovely breakfast at Hotel de la Villeon, we headed to Maison Chapoutier which is&nbsp;a short walk from the hotel. This area, the northern part of the Rhone Valley, produces more complex wines that are less fruit-forward than the wines I tasted further&nbsp;south. Maison Chapoutier is a great place‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Last week, I spent a whirlwind 6 days in the Rhone Valley. I loved meeting many of the winemakers, hearing their stories, walking through the vineyards, and driving to the tops of (so many) peaks. There was so much to see in addition to the wine ‚Äì olive trees, lavender, cherry trees, apricot trees, wild vegetables, and herbs growing everywhere. It‚Äôs a heavenly place to visit if you love fruit, vegetables, and wines as much as I do. All of the vineyards listed here are open daily&nbsp;for tasting. If you call in advance you can schedule a more personal tour‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>This salad was once again inspired by my bi-weekly Farmhouse Delivery bushel. What I love most about receiving a box of&nbsp;‚Äúsurprise‚Äù vegetables is that it takes the guesswork out of deciding what‚Äôs for dinner. My general CSA strategy is to&nbsp;try to use the lettuces first so I usually start my week with a big salad for dinner. This&nbsp;salad is an all-veggie version of a cobb salad. It‚Äôs&nbsp;packed with&nbsp;fresh summer corn, crispy cucumbers, zucchini and the first of the seasons‚Äô cherry tomatoes. I made a creamy vegan cashew-based ‚Äúbuttermilk-like‚Äù dressing and coconut ‚Äúbacon.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lot of quotation marks for one‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Hello from France! This past week, I‚Äôve been in the&nbsp;Rhone Valley touring vineyards, tasting wine, taking in amazing views and of course eating great food. I‚Äôll be back later this week&nbsp;with a new recipe, but for now here are some photos from my trip ‚Äì of course, follow along on Instagram to see more! Au Revoir!
