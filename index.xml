The 1080p version offers 158 pixels per inch, and the 2160p model is about 317 pixels per inch, which is a big difference. The benefit of the lower resolution display is battery life, in addition to cost, and some people would be able to run it at 100% scaling to avoid any issues there, although Windows defaults this display to 150% out of the box.</description></item><item><title>'Mayans M.C.'
