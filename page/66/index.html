Anecdotally, my grocery store only stocks one whole grain mustard and, like, 800 other types of mustard (that second figure is an exaggeration, but my point stands).&nbsp;
So, what is whole grain mustard, anyway? In short, it’s mustard made with whole (or nearly whole) mustard seeds.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chaz Ebert biography &amp;amp; movie reviews</h2><time>Mar 12, 2024</time>
