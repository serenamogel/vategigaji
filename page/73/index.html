<a href=../../joe-dirt-2001.html></a>
We professional movie critics count it a banner week when only one movie involves eating, falling into or being covered by excrement (or a cameo appearance by Carson Daly). We are not prudes. We are prepared to laugh. But what these movies, including "Joe Dirt," often do not understand is that the act of being buried in crap is not in and of itself funny.
Third-graders might think so (they're big on fart jokes, too), but trust me: When Joe Dirt thinks he has an atom bomb, until the cap gets knocked off, and a geyser of brown crud pours out, and he just stands there while it covers him--that's not funny.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jon Dickson - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</h2><time>Feb 18, 2024</time>

Interviews Tavernier looks beyond usual suspects Roger Ebert &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2003-05-08 During the Nazi Occupation of France, when the country was governed by the German-controlled Vichy administration, 220 films were made by French filmmakers. Bertrand Tavernier is fascinated by this fact: "None of them was anti-Semitic, pro-German, pro-collaboration, or pro-even Vichy. Except for one film which has two dubious lines, you never had a anti-Semitic remark in the films of that time--even though you had plenty in the 1930s.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Substitute All Purpose Flour for Cake Flour</h2><time>Feb 16, 2024</time>
