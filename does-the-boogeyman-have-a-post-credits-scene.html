Directed by Rob Savage, the film centers around the Harper family, who are still reeling from an unfathomable death. But when a mysterious man brings an otherworldly presence into their home unknowingly, the monstrous creature latches on to the Harper clan and brings forth sinister intentions.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Like a variety of other widely popular King adaptations, Savage’s supernatural extravaganza deals with the tremendous guilt, trauma, and suffering that a family can experience after the unexpected death of a loved one. And with a horror film jam-packed with intense jump scares and frightening visuals, it hardly comes as a surprise that moviegoers were sitting in theaters with anticipation simply wondering if there was more to come after the credits have rolled.</p><h2 id=h-does-the-boogeyman-have-a-post-credits-scene data-injectable=false>Does The Boogeyman have a post-credits scene?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-boogeyman-david-dastmalchian.jpg><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Despite the inclusion of end-credits scenes becoming significantly popular in mediums like the MCU, horror fanatics will be saddened to learn that The Boogeyman does <strong>not</strong> have a post-credits scene. This certainly comes as no major shock, as the majority of King adaptations don’t feature an end-credits scene — with 2017’s It being the exception.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=false>Of course, not having a post-credits scene doesn’t mean a sequel isn’t still possible. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In the final scene</a> of The Boogeyman, it is hinted that the devilish creature could still be alive, despite seemingly being burned alive by Sadie and Sawyer Harper. In the closing moments, Sadie hears her therapist call for her to come back inside the office, but Sadie soon discovers that the therapist isn’t around. And seeing as the Boogeyman can change voices to lure people in, then perhaps the monster is still alive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2LBqbGMm6aon5WuuqK6jKGYr51dlnqxu9KtZJyqlZm2tb%2BMrJqeppVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-a-plane-fly-for-24-hours.html><span>←</span><span>Can a plane fly for 24 hours?</span></a>
