Anytime someone says speaks to her, she seemingly has the perfect clap-backs. For this reason, t-shirts covered in any of her one-liners would suffice for Christmas. T-shirts reading, “I’m not in a bad mood. This is just how I look,” or “I’ll stop wearing black when they invent a darker color,” are available on Amazon.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Thing toy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wed-1.jpg><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>Thing happens to be Wednesday’s closest friend and confidant in the show. The creepy-looking hand crawls around on his fingertips to help her out whenever she is dealing with unprecedented drama or struggles. A Thing toy made out of squishy or plastic material would be an incredibly thoughtful Christmas gift for someone who loves Wednesday. Thing toys are available on Etsy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Black umbrella</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wednesday.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>In plenty of promos for the show, Wednesday is holding a very important item behind her shoulder and head—a black umbrella. Since she always shields herself from the light of the sun, her skin remains pale. A solid black umbrella would suit any youngster who wants to keep up with Wednesday’s vibe.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Addams Family board game</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wed-3.jpg><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>The Addams Family board game is a great pastime for people who not only love Wednesday but all members of The Addams Family. The game, which is available at Macy’s, can accommodate up to seven players. It gives everyone a chance to work their way through dungeons, trap doors, and cemeteries across the board while moving from level to level.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Poison potion water bottle</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wed-4.jpg><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Wednesday is the type of fictional character who isn’t shy when it comes to dealing with something as tricky and daunting as poison. A “poison potion” bottle to hold regular drinking water, soda, or juice is the perfect gift for someone who loves Wednesday as much as they enjoy apothecary and gothic themes. Different variations of this bottle are available on Amazon and Etsy.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>This article includes affiliate links, which may provide small compensation to We Got This Covered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmZ6rpGK0qrLTrGSfp6Jis6K60mamn2WnmrGvsdKdmLJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sora-kingdom-hearts-taco-bell.html><span>←</span><span>Kingdom Hearts fans want Sora to work a part-time job in KH4 after he was name-dropped i</span></a>
